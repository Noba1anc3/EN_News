​		The highest point on Earth got a bit higher Tuesday as China and Nepal finally agreed on a precise **elevation** for Mount Everest after years of debate.

​		The agreed height of 8, 848.86 metres (29, 031 feet) was 86 centimetres higher than the measurement previously recognized by Nepal, and more than four metres above China's official figure.

​		This **discrepancy** was due to China measuring the rock base on the summit and not the covering of snow and ice on the peak.

​		Tectonic plates

​		Nepal decided to conduct a survey — initially alone and later joined by China — after suggestions that **tectonic** plate movements including a major earthquake in 2015 may have affected the height.

​		Last spring, Nepali surveyors reached the summit of Everest with over 40 kilograms (90 pounds) of equipment, including a Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS) receiver. They spent roughly two **freezing** hours collecting data as dozens of climbers stood on top of the mountain.

​		"Climbing Everest alone is a challenging task, but we also had to measure it, " Khim Lal Gautam, a Survey Department official who lost a toe to **frostbite** in the expedition, told AFP.

​		China involvement

​		Nepal was due to release the results earlier this year but then China became involved after a visit to Nepal in October 2019 by President Xi Jinping. This year a Chinese survey expedition had a more quiet working space on the summit as they were the only climbers on a mountain shut because of the coronavirus pandemic.

​		"Various countries have completed the measurement of the height... several times, " said Padma Kumari Aryal, Nepal's land minister.

​		"The results have been different on different occasions, so today we end these speculations."
