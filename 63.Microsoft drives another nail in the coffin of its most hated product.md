## Microsoft drives another nail in the coffin of its most hated product

​		Microsoft announced that its workplace chat software Teams will no longer be available on Internet Explorer as of November 30, and its 365 apps won't work on IE beginning August 17, 2021.

coffin  棺材

​		IE is **miraculously** still around after 25 years. Once the most-used web browser, Internet Explorer had been on a steady downward **trajectory** for years. Its share of the browser market fell below the 50% threshold in 2010 and now sits at about 4%, according to browser usage tracker NetMarketShare.

trajectory  轨道，弹道，轨迹

​		Internet Explorer debuted in 1995 as part of Windows 95 and became an instant hit. It achieved a virtual **monopoly** in the early 2000s.

monopoly  垄断

​		But Microsoft failed to innovate, essentially leaving IE6 alone to gather dust and **cobwebs** for five years. That frustrated customers and sent them fleeing for greener **pastures**. Internet Explorer became **synonymous** with bugs and outdated technology.

cobweb  蜘蛛网

pasture  牧场; 生活状况

synonymous  同义的

​		Microsoft finally released IE 7 in 2006, but the damage was done — Microsoft paved the way for Firefox and Chrome to surpass it.

​		It wasn't until IE 9 in 2011 that Microsoft released a modern browser. Still, to this day, IE doesn't support extensions, it isn't available on non-Windows devices, and it doesn't sync with other devices by default — all mainstays of Chrome and Firefox.

​		"Customers have been using IE 11 since 2013 when the online environment was much less sophisticated than the landscape today, " the company said."Since then, open web standards and newer browsers — like the new Microsoft Edge — have enabled better, more innovative online experiences."

​		Microsoft said IE isn't going away just yet."We want to be clear that our customers' own legacy IE 11 apps and investments will continue to work, " Microsoft said.
