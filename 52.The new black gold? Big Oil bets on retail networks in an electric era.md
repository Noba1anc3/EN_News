## The new black gold? Big Oil bets on retail networks in an electric era

​		Under pressure from investors and governments alike to cut emissions, major European oil companies are ploughing billions into renewable energy but are struggling to craft business plans.

​		Europe's big oil firms, however, have another card to play: their vast global networks of filling stations.
BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Total all say they are betting on higher profits from sales of groceries and snacks at their retail networks, which will still be an essential port of call for motorists in an electric era. Even with the fastest electric vehicle (EV) chargers, customers would have at least 10 to 15 minutes to kill — plenty of time to grab a coffee and do some shopping.

​		While the so-called marketing operations of big oil firms — retail sales of fuel, lubricants, groceries and TV dinners — usually contribute a smaller slice of profits than oil and gas production, they typically have higher margins.

​		The renewable energy and power businesses tend to have lower returns on investment, making it important for oil firms to find ways to boost their overall returns in low-carbon economies.

​		That's why Shell plans to expand its retail network by more than 20% to 55, 000 sites worldwide by 2025. BP aims to increase its network of filling stations by nearly 50% to 29, 000 by 2030 and boost its EV charging network to 70, 000 points.

​		BP and Shell are also betting that daily contact with tens of millions of customers will give it masses of data that it can use to tailor sales for shoppers throughout the world.
