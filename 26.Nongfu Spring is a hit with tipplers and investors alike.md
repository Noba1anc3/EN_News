## Nongfu Spring is a hit with tipplers and investors alike

​		"We are not manufacturers of water. We are porters of nature." So goes a famous quip by Zhong Shanshan, the 66-year-old founder and boss of Nongfu Spring, China’s most popular brand of bottled water. On September 8th the Hangzhou-based bottler listed on Hong Kong’s bourse to spectacular **fanfare**. Its market capitalisation reached $53bn. Mr Zhong, who still owns 84% of Nongfu Spring, is now China’s third-richest person.

​		One reason for Nongfu’s success is its effort to cater to all market segments. **Stingy** folk can buy a mass-market 380ml-plastic bottle for as little as 1.5 yuan. The **well-heeled** may opt for the glass-bottled version, which comes with "award-winning" designs and retails for 30-45 yuan. In between you can get a lithium-rich liquid which is claimed to benefit the nervous system.

​		Nongfu sceptics point out that the bottled-water industry, in China and elsewhere, has few technical barriers to entry. The main raw material is polyethylene terephthalate (pet), a plastic that is cheap and easy to process. No special knowledge is required. **Evergrande**, a Chinese **property developer**, boasts its own line of bottled water called Evergrande Spring. The water itself tends to be an afterthought.

​		Not in Nongfu’s case. As its aggressive marketers never tire of stressing, it possesses water-extraction permits for ten of China’s most famous unspoilt bodies of water—from Thousand Island Lake in the eastern province of Zhejiang to Mount Tianshan in the remote western region of Xinjiang. The permits, granted by local governments for up to 30 years, are a **moat** against competitors. Loris Li, an independent analyst of China’s beverage industry, observes that "the quality of the original water source" can be a strong point of brand differentiation.
