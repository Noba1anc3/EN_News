​		In partnership with Wanda Film Holding Co., the Imax affiliate will also upgrade to laser technology at 10 cinemas in big cities including Beijing and Shanghai. The operation of some theaters will be converted to a recurring revenue-sharing model and `pandemic safety` steps will be taken, Imax China Holding Inc. Chairman Richard Gelfond said.

​		The cinema chain and partner Imax are `counting on` business to **bounce back** in China.
