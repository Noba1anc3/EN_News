## Why Rishi got it wrong

​		Since March Britain has been shielding workers and their families from the ruinous effects of the pandemic primarily through its **furlough** scheme, which pays 80% of workers' salaries.

​		Until recently Rishi Sunak, the chancellor of the exchequer, had been planning to introduce a stripped-down replacement for his furlough scheme. But at the last minute, the chancellor changed his mind and opted instead to continue with an adjusted scheme that is due to start on November 1st.

​		Under the new rules, workers need put in only 20% of their normal scheduled hours, and the government will cover half their normal pay.

​		By making it easier for bosses to keep workers on the books, Britain will **for the time being** sweep the pent-up rise in unemployment under the carpet.

​		But the about-turn makes it more likely that the government will protect jobs for which there is no demand. At least 1m jobs supported by the new furlough scheme, representing about 3% of the workforce, are unlikely to survive `in the long run`.

​		The cost of supporting these jobs, which is probably around £1bn a month, is a problem in itself. What is more worrying is the likelihood that the government is **retarding** economic recovery by discouraging the reallocation of workers from dying industries to growing ones.

​		It is not too late to change course. The government should not just cancel a planned reduction in the value of universal credit, but sharply increase its value, so as to ensure that workers whose jobs disappear earn the same as those who stay on furlough. That would allow the necessary reallocation of resources without forcing people into **penury**.
