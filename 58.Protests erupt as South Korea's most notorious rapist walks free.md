## Protests erupt as South Korea's most notorious rapist walks free

​		Protesters gathered outside a prison in southern Seoul on Saturday, shouting "Send him to hell!" and "**Castrate** him!, " as Cho Doo-soon was released. Police officers built **barricades** to allow the van carrying Cho to pass. Protesters kicked at the van and **hurled** eggs and insults at the vehicle. Anonymous death threats were issued against Cho online.

​		Cho was arrested in 2008 and later **convicted** of raping an 8-year-old girl, and his name has since become synonymous with the soft-glove treatment sex offenders are said to receive in the country's courts.

convict  定罪

​		South Korean courts have long been accused of **leniency** in meting out justice to sex offenders. Cho's drunkenness, age and "weak mental state" were cited as **mitigating** factors when the court sentenced him to 12 years in prison.

leniency  仁慈；宽大

mitigate  减轻；缓和

​		Public anger has surged in recent months as the date of Cho's release approached. On Wednesday, the **National Assembly** passed a bill, nicknamed the "Cho Doo-soon law, " which banned people convicted of sexually assaulting minors from leaving their homes at night or during hours when students commute to and from school.

​		Cho was seen wearing an electronic ankle monitor when he left prison on Saturday and was ordered to wear it for seven years. The police installed a monitoring system at his home and will make random visits there to check on him. They also have added 35 surveillance cameras, brighter streetlights and police booths in Cho's neighborhood to monitor his movements and deter people who have threatened to attack him.
