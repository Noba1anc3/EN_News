## The art of giving good workplace advice

​		Think back to the last time you were discussing a challenge `at work` and someone chimed in to offer their opinion. Did you welcome their advice?Probably not.

​		Coaching expert and author Michael Bungay Stanier discovered that advice-giving has become **endemic** in the workplace. He argues that our tendency to **dispense** advice `stems from` society teaching us that success means having all the answers.

dispense  分配; 分发

​		Most of the time our intentions are good. However, every time we `rush in` to give advice, we are unleashing what he calls our inner 'advice monster'.He says it needs to stop, because in our **haste** we are likely to give the wrong advice, or the relationship is too new for the advice to be **heeded**.

haste  急速; 匆忙

heed  留心; 注意

​		The first step toward **taming** the advice monster is to pay attention to just how quickly it emerges. Another way of `keeping it in check` is reflecting on how advice can erode confidence and autonomy in the person on the receiving end.

tame  驯化; 驯服

​		These days, leaders cannot realistically expect to have all the answers."As a leader, you can't be the expert in everything anymore. It's stressful to put that pressure on yourself, and it creates a bottleneck of everybody having to come to you for the answers, "says Dr Julia Milner, professor of leadership at EDHEC Business School in Nice, France and director of the International Center for Leadership Coaching.

​		The answer to the problem is coaching, say experts. It involves helping others devise their own solutions, by asking questions rather than offering advice.

​		One final piece of advice from Stanier is this: If you do decide to go ahead and give advice, frame it in a way that the other person can ignore it without anyone losing face.

​		Or don't — that's just our advice.
