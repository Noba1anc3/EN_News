## China launches antitrust investigation into Alibaba

​		The State Administration for Market Regulation, China's top market regulator, said Thursday that it would **probe** alleged **monopolistic** behavior by Alibaba, Jack Ma's online shopping and cloud computing giant. It gave few details but said it would investigate the company's practice of requiring merchants to sign agreements that prevent them selling products on rival platforms, known as "choosing one from two."

​		Alibaba, which was founded in 1999, has quickly transformed into a sprawling tech empire touching every aspect of Chinese life. Its e-commerce platforms boast hundreds of millions of users and dominate China's online retail sector.

​		Days after the Ant Group IPO was pulled in early November, the SAMR revealed new guidelines that it says are intended to prevent internet monopolies. That move **spooked** investors and immediately wiped hundreds of billions of dollars off Chinese tech stocks.

​		Pressure has been building since. On Wednesday, the SAMR summoned six internet giants — Alibaba, Tencent, JD.com, Meituan, Pinduoduo and Didi Chuxing — to a meeting, telling them it was increasing regulation of a business practice that allow groups of people in the same community to buy bulk goods at extremely low prices.

​		The group buying model has gained in popularity in China in recent years, especially during the coronavirus pandemic as people relied increasingly on online shopping for goods or services. The SAMR said Wednesday it was concerned that the model enabled dumping of goods at unreasonably low prices, hurting employment in other sectors of the economy.

​		Alibaba said in a statement that it "will actively cooperate with the regulators on the investigation".
