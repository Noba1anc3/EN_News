## A-levels and GCSEs: Student tells minister 'you've ruined my life'

​		With school exams canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic, this year's grades in England were awarded using a controversial modeling system, with the key factors being the ranking order of pupils and the previous exam results of schools and colleges. In England, 36% of entries had grades lower than their teachers predicted and 3% were down two grades, prompting anger and **distress** among schools, colleges and students.

​		Nina Bunting-Mitcham, a student, told the BBC her teachers were "utterly shocked" on learning her predicted results in biology, chemistry and psychology had **plummeted**.

​		The pupil confronted schools minister Nick Gibb on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions on Friday."I feel my life has been completely ruined. I can't get into any universities with such grades or progress further in my life. You have ruined my life."

​		There have been calls to move away from the system and use teachers' predictions — following a U-turn by the government in Scotland, where downgraded results have been replaced by the original teacher estimates.

​		But England's exam watchdog, Ofqual, has warned that using teachers' predictions would have artificially inflated results — and would have seen about 38% of entries getting A*s and As in England.

​		Robert Halfon, the Conservative chairman of the Commons Education Committee, joined opposition parties in expressing concern over what Labor termed an "exams **fiasco**".He called on Ofqual to publish details of the algorithm it used to make its calculations, adding: "If the model has penalized disadvantaged groups, this is very serious."
