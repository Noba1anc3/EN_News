## Do dreams reflect reality

​		It is only since the publication of Sigmund Freud's treatise "The Interpretation of Dreams", in 1899, that dreams have become a subject of serious scientific scrutiny. However, his emphasis on violent urges and sexual repression as the roots of dreaming now looks old-fashioned.

​		Instead, the **premise** is that dreams reflect a dreamer's **quotidian** experience — either because they are an **epiphenomenon** of the **consolidation** of memories or because they are a mental testing ground for ideas. This **resemblance** between dreams and reality is **dubbed** the continuity hypothesis by psychologists.

​		Three researchers from Italy and Britain have analyzed thousands of reports of dreams experienced by mentally healthy people. Using these, they have tested several predictions based on the continuity hypothesis and found support for all of them.

​		As to sex differences, men — the more violent sex in the waking world — had (as predicted) more violent dreams than women did. The three researchers were also able to show that the dreams of individuals do indeed change as they move through adolescence and into young adulthood.

​		Waking experience, the algorithm showed, shapes dreams in other ways as well. A **veteran** of the Vietnam war, who had had intense exposure to violence during that conflict, dreamed more frequently of violence and aggression than those with no military background.

veteran  经验丰富者; 老兵

​		By these tests, then, the continuity hypothesis seems to **pass muster**. None of them, admittedly, seeks to answer the deeper question of what dreams are actually for. Whether a computational approach like this can investigate that matter as well remains to be seen.
