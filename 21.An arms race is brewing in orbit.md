## An arms race is brewing in orbit

​		Kosmos 2542, a Russian satellite that was launched in November, was "like Russian nesting dolls", said General John Raymond, head of America's newly formed Space Force, in February. Eleven days after its launch it disgorged another satellite, labelled Kosmos 2543. Then, on July 15th, Kosmos 2543 itself spat out another object, which sped off into the void.

​		Merely a "small space vehicle" to inspect other satellites, said the Russians. Nonsense, said the Americans; it was a **projectile**.

projectile  炮弹

​		Anti-satellite weapons are not new. During the cold war, America and the Soviet Union developed several ways to **blow up**, **ram**, dazzle and even **nuke** each other's satellites. The countries conducted two-dozen anti-satellite tests between them.

blow up  引爆；炸毁

ram  撞击；塞进

nuke  核武器

​		But new competitors, and new technologies, mean anti-satellite warfare is a hot topic once again.

​		There is little in the way of law or custom to restrain this new arms race. Alarmed by the risks, several groups of diplomats and lawyers are trying to change that, and work out how to extend the laws that cover Earth-bound war into orbit.

​		The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 requires states to consult each other on actions that "would cause potentially harmful interference", though the rule has rarely been **heeded**. A group of experts has met regularly at the UN to try to hash out a solution, without much progress.

heed  留心；注意

​		Back in orbit, the problem is pressing. As space gets more "congested and contested", the diplomats and lawyers have their work cut out.
