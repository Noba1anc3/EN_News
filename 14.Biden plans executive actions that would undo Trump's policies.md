​		Biden's first focus is likely to be the worsening coronavirus pandemic. He is set to name a 12-person coronavirus task force, two sources with knowledge of his plans said.

​		He is also **poised** to **enact** a series of executive actions that would undo many of Trump's foreign policy actions and seek to rapidly return the United States to its status at the end of former President Barack Obama's administration four years earlier.

​		Biden repeatedly promised on his first day in office to rejoin the Paris climate accord, a landmark international deal to combat climate change that Trump exited in 2017. He has also said he would rejoin the World Health Organization, which Trump moved to withdraw from this year.

​		Both actions **underscore** a major difference between Biden and Trump: Biden has long believed in the `multilateral` organizations and pacts that Trump distrusts.

​		The outcome of the election — with Republicans still holding a narrow Senate majority, though Democrats would gain control of the chamber if they win what could be two Senate runoffs in Georgia in early January — underscores the difficulty Biden will have winning legislative victories, heightening the importance of his administration's executive actions.

​		The Biden-Harris transition Twitter account tweeted that the incoming administration will take on the "most urgent" challenges facing the nation, listing, "protecting and preserving our nation's health, renewing our opportunity to succeed, advancing `racial equity`, and fighting the `climate crisis`."
