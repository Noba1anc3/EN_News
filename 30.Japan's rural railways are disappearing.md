## Japan's rural railways are disappearing

​		**Tucked** away in the **verdant** mountains of Shimane, in western Japan, Gobira railway station has nearly disappeared. Its last departure was in the spring of 2018, when the 108km-long Sanko Line, which snaked through six municipalities in Shimane and Hiroshima prefectures, closed after 88 years.

​		The line was losing ¥900m a year when it shut."It was a difficult decision, " says Masuda Kazutoshi, a former mayor of one of the towns served, who oversaw the process.

​		Japan is a railway powerhouse. The famed shinkansen, or bullet trains, connect far-flung corners of the country. Two new stations were added this year to Tokyo's already expansive commuter-rail network to ease congestion at rush hour and provide better access to venues for the Olympics.

​		Yet many railways in rural areas face a similar fate to the Sanko Line. A total of 44 lines, spanning over 1, 000 km, have closed since 2000.

​		Three-quarters of local railway companies are unprofitable. The shrinking and aging of the population, which are especially acute in rural areas, have **drained** away passengers and revenue. The government provides relatively little support for struggling lines.

​		"Japan thinks Tokyo is the only place people live in, " says Morita Ippei of Gounokawa Railway, an organization seeking to **revitalize** the towns along the Sanko Line."The Sanko Line disappeared. We were abandoned, discarded."

​		"If we continue down this path, every form of public transport in rural regions will disappear in the future, " warns Utsunomiya Kiyohito of Kansai University.
