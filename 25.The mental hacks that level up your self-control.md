## The mental hacks that level up your self-control

​		By definition, self-control is the ability to do something that benefits your long-term goals, instead of something that might satisfy your immediate desires. But for many of us, short-term satiations are irresistible — we end up sacrificing the well-being of our future selves all too easily.

​		Why is exercising proper self-control so **tricky** for some, and how can you **harness** your own restraint **for good**?

tricky  难办的; 狡猾的

harness  控制

for good  永远

​		Angela Duckworth, professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, says allocating resources between your present self and future self is an ongoing struggle. Even though you know the importance of preparing for your future, your present self also wants their fair share. It's a tough negotiation, especially during the moments when the "easy road" is laying right in front of you.

​		For example, exhibiting self-control over spending time on video games and social media, two of the most common **temptations** of the current era, means battling against age-old mechanisms in your brain — like your desire for social interaction or **penchant** for hunting.

temptation  诱惑

penchant  爱好

​		One of the most important discoveries about self-control in recent years, says Duckworth, is that people vary widely in terms of what tempts them. Once you understand the sources of your self-control **woes**, you can begin devoting energy toward fixing them.

woe  麻烦; 问题

​		To improve self-control at work, Duckworth first recommends taking a future-oriented approach to your day, such as planning breaks and the time slots for checking emails in advance. If you can refrain from resigning to your urges before the time you've **allotted** for yourself, you may achieve a greater handle on your overall self-control.
