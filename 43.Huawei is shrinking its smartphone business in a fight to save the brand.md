​		Huawei and the group of buyers said they struck the deal to help save Honor's supply chain. The Trump administration has cut off the Chinese company's access to vital technology, such as chipsets and software for its smartphones and 5G telecommunications equipment.

​		Selling Honor means the **embattled** Shenzhen company can now free up resources to focus on its own brand of flagship smartphones, according to Nicole Peng, analyst at market research firm Canalys.

​		Huawei's "future and outlook is still very uncertain, " said Will Wong, analyst with market research firm IDC."So they need to focus on what they have, and the best thing they have are the high-end models."Focusing on the flagship devices will help Huawei "maintain their high-end brand image and also generate more revenue, " said Wong.

​		Without Honor, Huawei's total smartphone sales will take a hit.

​		Earlier this year, the company achieved its long-time goal and briefly became the world's top smartphone seller, helped by a **slump** in sales at rival Samsung.

​		In the period when Huawei eked out a win over its South Korean rival, Honor made up more than a quarter of the company's total smartphone sales, according to IDC and Canalys. Without the roughly 15 million Honor devices sold in the April-June quarter, Huawei would not have landed on top of the **podium**.
