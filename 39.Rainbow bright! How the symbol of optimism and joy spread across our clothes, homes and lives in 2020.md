## Rainbow bright! How the symbol of optimism and joy spread across our clothes, homes and lives in 2020

​		The rainbows started appearing all over Italy within a few days of schools closing for the first lockdown, back in March. Crayon drawings were taped to the inside of windows; poster-painted **banners** hung from balconies.

​		When the pandemic came to Britain the rainbows came too, with the Italian message of positivity morphing into thanks to the NHS. Then, during the months of lockdown, the rainbows moved inside our homes, with a craze for arranging books by color in pursuit of an aesthetically pleasing Zoom **backdrop**.

​		The rainbow is to 2020 what "keep calm and carry on" was to 1939. And, just as "keep calm and carry on" began as a public information campaign but became a tea towel industry, what began as a gesture of hope is now big business. John Lewis reports that an £8 rainbow bauble is an early festive bestseller. Tracksuit **aficionados** are sitting out the second lockdown in Olivia Rubin's £150 pastel-toned rainbow **stripe** tracksuits.

​		Optimism is the hottest commodity of 2020. But some people are **irritated** by the way consumer culture **commodifies** the human experience, packaging our hopes and dreams as if they were just another product in the warehouse.

​		But, says the fashion editor turned designer JJ Martin:"It's great to have the colorful dress, but what really counts is the flame you turn on inside yourself."

​		The magic of a rainbow isn't really about the pot of gold, but the calm after the storm. In the optimism economy, it really is the thought that counts.
