## The UN renews its vows in a 75-th　birthday general non-assembly

​		At this time of year New York City is normally gridlocked. World leaders and their **delegations**, as well as **hordes** of consultants and folk from non-governmental organisations, flood into town for the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).

​		This year's gathering was meant to be special, marking the 75th anniversary of the UN's founding in 1945. But the constraints of covid-19 have ensured that the UNGA of 2020 will stand out in a different way: as a general non-assembly. World leaders will deliver pre-recorded video messages to the session's general debate that starts on September 22nd. The formal commemoration on September 21st of the UN's 75th anniversary will thus be a **subdued** affair.

​		Given the troubled state of the world, this was not deemed to be a time for a boastful birthday **bash**. The UN's secretary-general, António Guterres, decided to use the anniversary for a "global conversation", consulting world opinion through a series of surveys and meetings. He will present the results, in a report called "The future we want, the United Nations we need", on September 21st.

​		Preliminary findings released in April suggested that the world thinks more or less what the UN hoped it would: people's priorities are environmental protection, less conflict and equal access to basic services. Fully 95% of respondents to the UN's online survey believe international co-operation is "essential" or "very important".
​		The pandemic is a powerful example of the need for such co-operation (to share data, spread best practices and ensure that when vaccines are ready for use they are distributed efficiently).So is climate change, and from the cybersphere to space, global governance is increasingly needed.
