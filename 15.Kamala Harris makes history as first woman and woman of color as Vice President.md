## Kamala Harris makes history as first woman and woman of color as Vice President

​		With her ascension to the vice presidency, Harris will become the first woman and first `woman of color` to hold that office, a milestone for a nation in **upheaval**, grappling with a damaging history of `racial injustice` exposed, yet again, in a divisive election.

​		That she has risen higher in the country's leadership than any woman ever has underscores the extraordinary arc of her political career.

​		A former San Francisco district attorney, she was elected as the first Black woman to serve as California's attorney general. When she was elected a U.S. senator in 2016, she became only the second Black woman in the chamber's history.

​		Almost immediately, she `made a name for herself` in Washington with her **withering** prosecutorial style in Senate hearings, **grilling** her adversaries in high-stakes moments that at times `went viral`.

​		Yet what also distinguished her was her personal biography: The daughter of a Jamaican father and Indian mother, she was **steeped** in racial justice issues from her early years in Oakland and Berkeley, California.

​		The small sorority of Black women in federal politics also views Harris as a mentor and an ally, praising her championing of issues like Black maternal mortality and anti-lynching legislation that have not typically received the spotlight that can follow a high-wattage political brand.

​		Kimberlé Crenshaw, a prominent Black progressive scholar, **hailed** Harris' ascension to the vice presidency and described her as "`well positioned` to weather the storms that will definitely come `now that` she has broken through the glass ceiling."
