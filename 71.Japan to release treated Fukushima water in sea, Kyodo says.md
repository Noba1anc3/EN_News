## Japan to release treated Fukushima water in sea, Kyodo says

​		Japan is planning to release millions of gallons of treated radioactive water from its wrecked Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean, Kyodo News reported.

​		The government has agreed on this plan and an official decision by the cabinet is expected as soon as this month, according to the news agency.

​		The release likely won't occur for another two years and could take decades to complete, Kyodo said. Storage tanks for the water at the site are forecast to be full by mid-2022.

​		"It's not true that the government has decided on a direction, or the timing for a decision, " Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told reporters in Tokyo on Friday."On the other hand, to avoid delaying the decommissioning of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, it is true that we can't put off forever a decision on how to dispose of the treated water."

​		Dumping the water into the ocean threatens to hurt Japan's relationship with South Korea, and comes despite opposition from environmental groups and the local fishing industry, which is still struggling to recover from the disaster.

​		The treated water contains tritium, making it weakly radioactive. While tritium's beta particles, those emitted during radioactive decay, are too low-energy to **penetrate** the skin, they can build up in the body if inhaled or consumed.

​		The International Atomic Energy Agency said in a report in April that it is ready to work with Japan "to develop a framework to provide radiation safety assistance before, during and after the disposition" once a decision on how to proceed has been made.
