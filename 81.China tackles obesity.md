## China tackles obesity

​		More than half of China's adult population is either overweight or obese, according to a new government report released Wednesday. Obesity rates in China have doubled within two decades, and health authorities are warning of a surge in chronic diseases such as diabetes, **hypertension** and cancer.

​		"The unhealthy lifestyles of residents is still common everywhere, " said Li Bin, the deputy director of China's National Health Commission, during a news conference Wednesday. Most households use salt and oil in quantities that exceed recommended guidelines and people are increasingly turning to processed foods and **greasy** restaurant meals.

​		In the past, China's health initiatives have emphasized the importance of exercise rather than cutting back on junk food and soda. But now, the frequent consumption of sugary beverages has presented itself as a prominent problem.

​		Li said that officials would take steps to curb the spike in obesity and chronic diseases with an initiative called "Healthy China 2030." Zhao Wenhua, the chief nutritionist at China's Center for Disease Control, said that officials would encourage manufacturers to produce snacks and beverages that are low in fat and sugar.

​		The obesity statistics in China are a part of a global pattern. Obesity among American adults has increased 12.4% over the past 18 years, with 42.4% of adults in the United States now living with the condition. Obesity has almost tripled around the world since 1975, according to the World Health Organization.

​		Obesity has also emerged as a major indicator of the severity of coronavirus symptoms in patients. A recent study from China that analyzed a group of 112 COVID-19 patients found that of the 17 patients who died, 15 were either overweight or obese.
