## Seven footprints may be the earliest evidence of humans on the Arabian Peninsula

​		A set of seven footprints made at a lake about 120, 000 years ago have been hailed as the earliest evidence of modern humans on the Arabian Peninsula — a discovery experts say could shed light on the spread of our species out of Africa.

​		Writing in the journal "Science Advances", an international team of researchers report how they found the footprints in an ancient lake deposit in the Nefund Desert, with dating of **sediment** above and below the prints revealing them to be between 112, 000 and 121, 000 years old.

​		The team argue that the size of the prints, the absence of evidence for Neanderthals in the area and the evidence that Homo sapiens were in Arabia almost 90, 000 years ago, suggest the impressions were most likely made by modern humans.

​		"At the time that humans were moving through this landscape, the area wouldn't have been hyper-**arid**, " said Richard Clark-Wilson, a co-author of the research. Instead, he said, at that time it would have been a grassy savannah with bodies of water, offering opportunities for human migration.

​		Dr Matthew Pope, an expert on ancient humans from University College London, who was not involved in the work, welcomed the findings."Footprints are so incredibly **evocative** — they are brilliant for dissolving time barriers, " he said.

​		While Pope said it was not possible to infer many details about the party from the prints, he said the work added to a shifting view of Arabia in relation to the movement of Homo sapiens out of Africa.
