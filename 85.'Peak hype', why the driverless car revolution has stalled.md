## 'Peak hype': why the driverless car revolution has stalled

​		By 2021, according to various Silicon Valley **luminaries**, **bandwagoning** politicians and leading cab firms in recent years, self-driving cars would have long been crossing the US, started filing along Britain's motorways and be all set to provide robotaxis in London.

​		1 January has not, however, brought a driverless revolution. In the last weeks of 2020, Uber, one of the biggest players and supposed **beneficiaries**, decided to park its plans for self-driving taxis, selling off its autonomous division to Aurora.

​		The decision did not, Uber's chief executive protested, mean the company no longer believed in self-driving vehicles. But more people might now take that promise with a pinch of salt.

​		Looking back, Prof Nick Reed, a transport consultant who ran UK self-driving trials, says"The technology worked…we are 90% of the way there. But it is that last bit which is the toughest. Being able reliably to do the right thing every single time, whether it's raining, snowing, fog, is a bigger challenge than anticipated."

​		Fears were stoked after Uber's self-driving car killed a pedestrian in Arizona in 2018. And despite Elon Musk's continuing bold claims for Tesla, the law is unlikely to permit drivers to **relinquish** the wheel soon. Problems such as social acceptance, cybersecurity and cost have never been addressed.

​		The driverless car world is "a great moonshot": cars are a huge market but also the hardest to transform, long after autonomous mining or rail or shuttle services are in place.
