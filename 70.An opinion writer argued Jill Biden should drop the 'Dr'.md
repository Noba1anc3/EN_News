## An opinion writer argued Jill Biden should drop the 'Dr'

​		Do people who go by Dr. need to carry **stethoscopes**? Joseph Epstein, a writer in "The Wall Street Journal" seems to think so, at least when it comes to Jill Biden, who has a **doctorate** in education and calls herself Dr. Jill Biden.

stethoscope  听诊器

doctorate  博士学位

​		"Any chance you might drop the 'Dr.' before your name?" he wrote."'Dr. Jill Biden' sounds and feels **fraudulent**, not to say a touch comic."

fraudulent  欺骗的

​		Sarah H. Parcak, who has a Ph.D. from Cambridge University, along with many others, said the suggestion that Biden not use the **honorific** was **blatantly** sexist and **emblematic** of the way many men question or **disparage** women's credentials.

honorific  表示尊敬的

blatantly  非常，极为，完全

emblematic  标志的

disparage  贬低；轻视

​		The raw nerve touched by the piece **underscored** the enduring power of the title — two letters that convey accomplishment, respect and authority.

underscore  强调

​		In the 19th century, people were **sued** for using "doctor" if they hadn't graduated from a recognized medical school, according to Naomi Rogers, a professor at Yale University.

sue  控告；诉讼

​		When women began graduating from medical schools in the middle of the 19th century, they called themselves doctors, she said. But newspapers and critics gave them a more **dismissive** title — doctoress — indicating that they were women.

dismissive  轻蔑的；鄙视的

​		"'Doctor' came to be prized as a unisex honorific, " Rogers said."That was the word that women M.D.s sought."

​		Biden is clearly proud of her job as a community college professor. Douglas Emhoff, the husband of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, said Biden had earned her degrees "through hard work and pure grit."

​		"She is an inspiration to me, to her students, and to Americans across this country, " he wrote on Twitter.
