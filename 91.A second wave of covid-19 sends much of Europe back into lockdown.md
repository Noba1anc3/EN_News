## A second wave of covid-19 sends much of Europe back into lockdown

​		For a few months this summer it was almost possible for Europeans to believe that life had returned to normal. Parisian museums and Barcelona's cafés were open, if less crowded.

​		In August and September, covid-19 infections began to rise. Yet governments, worried about a backlash, chose not to reintroduce harsh `social-distancing` measures.

​		Their decision has `had a price`. A second wave of covid-19 is now `washing over` Europe. In many countries the daily numbers of `confirmed cases` exceed their spring peaks, though this is mostly because there is a lot more testing; death rates are substantially lower.

​		Most countries failed to use the summer to build robust `testing and tracing` operations. Now they are falling back on **blunt** measures: shutting restaurants and introducing quarantines and curfews.
Spain is among the hardest-hit countries. Madrid is under a 15-day state of emergency that bars non-essential movement in or out of the city.

​		One step the EU took this month was to settle on a Europe-wide map of regional epidemic severity, after a disagreement over the colors. Almost every province in Europe shows up red (a high rate of the virus).

​		Germany remains Europe's star performer, though there are difficulties. Germany has the continent's best track-and-trace systems, but in parts of Berlin there are now too many cases to follow.

​		Angela Merkel, the chancellor, fears that going too slowly now could force more drastic restrictions later. That would erode the civic will needed to fight the virus.

​		Where Europeans once embraced that battle with a spirit of shared sacrifice, many now **grumble** that their governments are blowing it.
