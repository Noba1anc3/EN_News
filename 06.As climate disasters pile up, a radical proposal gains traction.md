## As climate disasters pile up, a radical proposal gains traction

​		As the effects of climate change become more devastating, prominent research institutions and government agencies are focusing new money and attention on an idea once **dismissed** as science fiction: artificially cooling the planet.

​		That strategy, called solar geoengineering, **entails** reflecting more of the sun's energy back into space — abruptly reducing global temperatures in a way that **mimics** the effects of ash clouds spewed by volcanic eruptions.

​		The idea has been **derided** as a dangerous and **illusory** fix. But as global warming continues, producing more destructive hurricanes, wildfires, floods and other disasters, some researchers and policy experts say that concerns about geoengineering should be outweighed by the imperative to better understand it.

​		"I liken geoengineering to **chemotherapy** for the planet: If all else is failing, you try it, " said Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.

​		One way to cool the earth is by injecting aerosols into the upper layer of the atmosphere, where those particles reflect sunlight away from the earth. That process works, according to Douglas MacMartin, a researcher in mechanical and aerospace engineering at Cornell University whose team received funding from a nonprofit organization called SilverLining.

​		What's still unclear, he added, is what happens next."What does it do to the strength of hurricanes? What does it do to agriculture yields?"

​		One goal of the research is to look for a sweet spot: the amount of artificial cooling that can reduce extreme weather events without causing broader changes in regional precipitation patterns or similar impacts.
