## How Donald Kendall, as PepsiCo's boss, sparked the cola wars

​		In 1983, PepsiCo **stunned** its bigger rival, Coca-Cola, by signing Michael Jackson, the era's biggest musical star, to promote its brand in a record-setting $5m deal.

​		The cola wars became a cultural phenomenon. Credit for that goes to Donald Kendall, PepsiCo's legendary former boss, who died on September 19th aged 99.

​		Mr Kendall offered a mix of strategic vision, principled leadership and marketing **flair**. But his **masterstroke** was the all-out marketing **blitz** against Coca-Cola, long the global market leader in non-alcoholic beverages.

​		The two firms had competed for decades, but they mostly fought low-grade battles. Mr Kendall changed that, by forcing both companies into an advertising arms race.

​		This was a risky gambit for both cola rivals. But it paid off in two ways. First, it helped fizzy drinks win a greater "share of throat" (a term coined by Roberto Goizueta, a former boss of Coca-Cola).They went from 12.4% of American beverage consumption in 1970 to 22.4% in 1985.

​		The second way that the cola wars benefited both companies was by turning them into "the world's best marketers", observes Kaumil Gajrawala of Credit Suisse, a bank. Today a decades-long obsession with cut-price volume growth has been replaced by a focus on revenues and profits. PepsiCo has **relinquished** some of the soft-drinks market. But its marketing magic continues to sparkle, even if it is deployed to sell less sugary alternatives.

​		"If there wasn't a Coca-Cola, we would have had to invent one, and they would have had to invent Pepsi, " observed Mr Kendall.
