## The incredible tale of a man who formed an unlikely bond with an octopus

​		Craig Foster was diving, bare-chested, in bitterly cold waters off the southern-most tip of Africa when he saw her — an octopus hiding under a **cloak** of shells and stones.

cloak  披风; 遮盖

​		**Enchanted**, he began following this incredibly shy creature, trying to prove he wasn't a predator by staying very still in her presence. And then, after 26 days of near obsessive **wooing**, she reached out and touched him.

enchanted  着了魔的; 狂喜的

woo  追求; 求爱

​		In the new Netflix documentary "My Octopus Teacher" this **tender** moment moves you in a way you never thought an octopus **tentacle** wrapped around a human hand could.

tender  和善的; 温柔的

tentacle  触手; 影响; 束缚

​		We see her outwitting a shark by **hitching** a ride on its back, growing a new tentacle after surviving a shark attack, and finally wasting away after laying a clutch of eggs.

​		"The octopus showed me many behaviors that were completely new to science, because this animal trusted me, " Foster says.

​		Foster has spent the last ten years diving in a kelp forest in the Atlantic Ocean off the west coast of South Africa. He began this daily diving regimen as a way of dealing with a depression that had left him raw and disconnected.

​		Immersing himself in this underwater world has calmed his mind. Over the years other animals have reached out to make contact, including otters, whales, cuttlefish and even sharks. But nothing has compared to his "once-in-a-lifetime" bond with the octopus, he says.

​		Foster says the greatest lesson she taught him is that humans are part of the natural world around us, and not simply visitors."Your own role and place in the natural world is singularly the most precious gift we have been given."
