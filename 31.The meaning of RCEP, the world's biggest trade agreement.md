## The meaning of RCEP, the world's biggest trade agreement

​		RCEP is the world's largest plurilateral trade agreement. It would have been bigger still had India not withdrawn a year ago. After eight years of "negotiating with blood, sweat and tears", the remaining countries have achieved a victory for regional co-operation at a time when covid-19 has **ravaged** the global economy.

ravage  毁坏; 损坏

​		RCEP's membership overlaps with that of another big regional trade pact, the CPTPP. When the two agreements were under negotiation, American officials would dismiss RCEP as an inferior, 20th-century-style pact, focused on **tariffs** and **rudimentary** trade-facilitation measures, in contrast to the TPP.

tariff  关税

rudimentary  基础的; 基本的

​		It is true that RCEP is less ambitious. It eliminates, by one estimate, about 90% of tariffs, but only over a period of 20 years after coming into effect.

​		But RCEP does `break new ground` in harmonizing the disparate rules-of-origin provisions in **ASEAN's** various **FTAs**, and setting regional-content rules so that intermediate goods can be sourced from any of the 15 countries.

ASEAN  东盟

FTA  自由贸易协定

​		As a result RCEP is expected to have a noticeable economic impact. A paper from the Peterson Institute for International Economics cites modeling showing that it will raise global GDP in 2030 by an annual $186bn (compared with a gain of $147bn from the CPTPP).

​		In joining its first plurilateral trade agreement, China can present itself as committed to trade liberalization at a time when America seems relatively disengaged from the region.

​		Li Keqiang, China's prime minister, called RCEP "a victory for multilateralism and free trade" and, more lyrically, "a ray of light and hope amid the clouds".
