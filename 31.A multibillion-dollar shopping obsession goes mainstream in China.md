## A multibillion-dollar shopping obsession goes mainstream in China

​		Eight months ago, Meng Hu quit her job as a flight attendant in Guangzhou, China to pursue her dream of becoming an influencer. Since January, she's been working full-time as a live-streaming host on Taobao, Alibaba's eBay-like online marketplace. There, she has built up a following of more than 400, 000 fans.
​		"I've been talking nonstop, " Hu said, laughing."My throat gets really **hoarse**.[In this job, ] you need to talk a lot, because your mood is contagious. Only when you talk enthusiastically can you get your audience excited."

​		Hu is part of a rising class of creators in China who are racing to get in on live-stream shopping, an emerging form of retail that has grown into an industry worth an estimated $66 billion. Although the trend has been part of Chinese internet culture for years, analysts say the coronavirus pandemic has made it mainstream.
​		Even the Chinese government has voiced its support, calling the industry the "new engine" of e-commerce growth. This February, for example, China's Ministry of Commerce encouraged e-commerce platforms to help farmers sell their produce online, particularly through live-streaming.
​		Even so, the industry's impact on the economy is probably limited, according to Xiaofeng Wang, a senior analyst at research firm Forrester. She noted that live-stream shopping is still a very small percentage — estimates suggest around 5% — of the country's e-commerce market, and a tiny share of the overall retail sector.
​		"I don't think live-stream e-commerce alone will save the economy, " Wang said.
