## China to open giant telescope to international scientists

​		**Nestled** among the mountains in southwest China, the world's largest radio telescope signals Beijing's ambitions as a global centre for scientific research.

​		The Five-hundred-metre Aperture **Spherical** Telescope (FAST) — the only significant instrument of its kind after the collapse of another telescope in Puerto Rico this month — is about to open its doors for foreign astronomers to use, hoping to attract the world's top scientific talent.

​		The Chinese installation in Pingtang, Guizhou province, is up to three times more sensitive than the US-owned one, and is surrounded by a five-kilometre "radio silence" zone.

​		Work on the FAST began in 2011 and it started full operations in January this year, working mainly to capture the radio signals emitted by **celestial** bodies, in particular pulsars.

​		China has been rapidly boosting its scientific credentials to become less reliant on foreign technology. In the past two decades, China has built the largest high-speed train network in the world, finalised its Beidou geolocation system and is now in the process of bringing lunar samples back to Earth.

​		The data being collected by FAST should allow for a better understanding of the origins of the universe — and aid in the search for alien life.

​		Improvements in scientific innovation have been rapid, said Denis Simon, an expert on Chinese science policy, adding that "China was viewed as an innovation **laggard**" only a few years ago.

​		"More and more **discretion** has been given to the scientific and engineering community to explore new ideas and take bigger risks in the research environment, " he said."The risk-**averse** culture that was once predominant has given way to a more **entrepreneurial** culture."
