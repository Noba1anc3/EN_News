## Uproar after Somali lawmaker presents bill to legalize child marriage

​		Hafsa was married off at 13 by her father to a man who paid $100. She and her mother say she was beaten and raped for two years.

​		There is no law **mandating** a minimum age for marriage in Somalia. A bill introduced in parliament this month by a presidential ally caused a storm of criticism from lawmakers when they realized it would legalize marriage at **puberty** — as early as 10 for some girls.

​		Data from a government survey this year shows that nearly a third of girls are married before their 18th birthday — just under half of those before the age of 15.

​		"Some families marry off their daughters to reduce their economic burden or earn income. Others may do so because they believe it will secure their daughters' futures or protect them, " said Dheepa Pandian, a spokeswoman from the United Nations' Children's Fund.

​		Political **turmoil** in Somalia — the prime minister was sacked last month and elections due this year will likely be delayed — means it is unclear when parliament might vote on the bill.

turmoil  动乱; 骚乱

​		Many lawmakers, like legislator and human rights activist Sahra Omar Malin, reject the bill."Our constitution is based on Islam. It says the age of maturity is 18, this is the right age for voting or for a girl to marry, " she said.

​		Deputy speaker Abdiweli Mudeey, who presented the bill, told lawmakers that it had been reviewed by **clerics** and "this bill ... is the correct one based on Islam."
