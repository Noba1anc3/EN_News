## Why Pfizer's ultra-cold COVID-19 vaccine will not be at the local pharmacy any time soon

​		Work to distribute the experimental COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE is `gearing up` after the companies announced successful **interim** data earlier on Monday, but it will not be coming to local pharmacies for the general public any time soon.

​		Pfizer and BioNTech need to get regulators to sign off on the shot before it can start shipping vaccines to those considered most in need by government. Healthcare workers and people living in nursing homes will likely top that list.

​		But the vaccine's complex and super-cold storage requirements are an obstacle for even the most sophisticated hospitals in the United States and may impact when and where it is available in rural areas or poor countries where resources are tight.

​		Pfizer spokeswoman Kim Bencker said the company was working closely with the U.S. government and state officials on how to ship the vaccine from its distribution centers in the United States, Germany and Belgium around the globe.

​		The detailed plan includes using dry ice to transport frozen vaccine **vials** by both air and land at their recommended temperatures for up to 10 days.

​		State and local healthcare providers are responsible for storing and administering vaccines once delivered. They can be kept in an ultra-low temperature freezer for up to six months, or for five days at 2-8 degrees C — a type of refrigeration commonly available at hospitals, Bencker said.

​		BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin told Reuters the companies are analyzing if they can extend that for two weeks.
