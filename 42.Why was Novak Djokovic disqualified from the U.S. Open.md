## Why was Novak Djokovic disqualified from the U.S. Open

​		Novak Djokovic's **default** from the U.S. Open after hitting a lineswoman in the neck with a ball that he struck toward the back of the court in frustration is perhaps the most costly one in tennis history.
It fell under the **Grand Slam** rule book's definition of "physical abuse, " which states that players "shall not at any time physically abuse any official, opponent, spectator or other person within the precincts of the tournament site."

​		In a statement, the U.S. Tennis Association said: "In accordance with the Grand Slam rule book, the U.S. Open tournament **referee** defaulted Novak Djokovic from the 2020 U.S. Open. Because he was defaulted, Djokovic will lose all ranking points earned at the U.S. Open and will be fined the prize money won at the tournament **in addition to** any or all fines levied with respect to the offending incident."

​		With Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer not competing, and Marin Cilic and Andy Murray having lost in the first week, Djokovic's exit leaves the tournament without any men who have previously won a Grand Slam title. There will be a first-time Grand Slam singles champion in men's tennis for the first time since Cilic at the 2014 U.S. Open.

​		Djokovic is not the first decorated champion to have a tournament end in controversy. At the 2009 U.S. Open, Serena Williams was given a point penalty while down **match point**, ending the match, after threatening to shove a ball down the throat of a lineswoman who had called her for a foot fault.
