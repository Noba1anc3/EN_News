## Pantone unveils its 2021 Color(s) of the Year: Ultimate Gray and Illuminating

​		As 2020 nears its **tumultuous** end, the Pantone Color Institute has taken up its annual task of forecasting the color that will best reflect the year ahead. In a decision **befitting** a complex time, the color authority has revealed two **hues** for its Color of the Year: the neutral Ultimate Gray and **vibrant** yellow **Illuminating**.

tumultuous  喧嚣的；动荡的

befit  适合

hue  颜色; 色度

vibrant  充满生机的; 鲜艳的; 醒目的

illuminate  照亮；照明

​		Pantone's Color of the Year reflects color trends in fashion, beauty, design and home decor, and the initiative has also served as a mood ring of sorts, selecting the hues capturing the spirit of the time.

​		Last year's Classic Blue offered a sense of **reassurance** as the world moved into a new decade. In late 2016, following the U.S. presidential election, Pantone selected Greenery for the following year, **alluding** to political turmoil and calling the color a hue for restoration and renewal.

reassurance  肯定；保证

allude  暗指；影射

​		This year's Illuminating is associated with optimism and **vivacity**, while Ultimate Gray encourages "feelings of **composure**, **steadiness** and resilience."

vivacity  活力；生气

composure  镇静；沉着

steadiness  稳定；踏实

​		In her own research into color associations, Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of Pantone, has found that yellow is often associated with "cheer" and "happiness, " due to its correlation with the sun.

​		Pantone's selection for Ultimate Gray, however, is a bit more complicated. Though it was selected for its qualities of **fortitude** and reliability, gray is linked with negative moods. In a year marked by mass illness and economic anxiety, such a selection isn't off base.

fortitude  勇气；刚毅

​		However people interpret Pantone's choices this year, Pantone emphasizes the strength of bringing two disparate colors together."What we were trying to demonstrate was how you have different elements that come together, and it's that coming together that expresses the strength and the hopefulness, " said Eiseman.
