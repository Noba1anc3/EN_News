### Class of 2020, 'you don't have to accept the world as it is'

​         Democracy isn't about relying on some charismatic leader to make changes from on high. It's about finding hope in ourselves, and creating it in others.   

​		Hope is not a lottery ticket; it's a hammer for us to use in a national emergency - to break the glass, sound the alarm and sprint into action.

### Extreme night owls: I can't tell anyone what time I go to bed

​		Our culture mistakenly associates sleeping little and rising early with virtue, it is often extolled as a habit of successful people. Yet this belies a glaring inconsistency: around eight hours of good-quality sleep is essential for better health for almost everybody.

### What we can learn from ‘untranslatable’ illnesses

​		In an era that's seeing drastic losses in diversity of virtually every other kind - from species to languages, it's been suggested that we're standing on a precipice, potentially about to lose our range of mental illnesses too.

​		In the book "Crazy Like Us", the author describes how we've spent the last few decades slowly, insidiously Americanizing mental illness. In the process, not only do we risk missing out on diagnoses and foregoing the most appropriate treatments, but the opportunity to understand how mental illnesses develop in the first place.
