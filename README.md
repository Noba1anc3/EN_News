Even if the smell could be put aside, the durian would still probably have the highest grapple factor among Southeast Asia's **endemic** fruits. Thai exports of the fruit are mostly destined for China, where consumers tend to be more willing to work for their meals.

### Senate confirms Barrett, delivering for Trump and reshaping the Court
