### Who will miss the coins when they're gone

​		Coins are everywhere until they're nowhere, and at the moment they're hard to find. By upending normal habits, the pandemic has dropped them out of circulation and accelerated a trend toward cards, apps and other cashless payments that could eventually make coins **obsolete**.

​		However, coins will always have defenders in curators and collectors. Dr. Fleur Kemmers, an **archaeologist** at Goethe University Frankfurt, called ancient coins "historic documents, " passed down by people across centuries and continents as they **haggled**, **hoarded** and made their way through daily life."They are **tangible** remains of past regimes, yet also part of the daily lives of ordinary people 2, 000 years ago, " she said.

​		Then as now, they became part of little rituals, symbols and gestures. Fearing bad luck, some don't pick up a penny unless it's heads-up. For centuries, people have tossed coins into wishing wells, or now their urban equivalent, the city fountain.

### In Afghanistan, fears of assassination overshadow hopes of peace

​		The **steady** `drum beat` of killings has `cast a shadow of` fear across the country, even as the government and Taliban are meant to be `hammering out` a peace deal. Many people see a connection between the two, even though the attacks have not all been claimed by the insurgents.

​		"Even if we only assume the Taliban are responsible for part of them, the message is clear: 'Be prepared for our rule, be prepared to surrender, we are coming back', " said Orzala Ashraf Nemat, the director of the Kabul-based thinktank AREU.

​		"It is to discourage the united struggle for `democratic values`, `freedom of speech`, education, even the enlightening side of religious scholarship. They are trying to do these attacks to create fear because their rule is fear-based."

​		The magic of a rainbow isn't really about the pot of gold, but the calm after the storm. In the optimism economy, it really is the thought that counts.

​		The most **infamous** fruit, which stinks of death, is the durian. The durian's flavor **elicits** passionate, and polarizing, responses, with few **indifferent** about the fruit's appeal or **repulsiveness**. On the outside, the durian resembles a medieval torture device. Nestled inside the **spiky** shell are kidney-shaped lobes of custard. Even if the smell could be put aside, the durian would still probably have the highest grapple factor among Southeast Asia's **endemic** fruits. Thai exports of the fruit are mostly destined for China, where consumers tend to be more willing to work for their meals.

### Airbnb was like a family, until the layoffs started

Chesky spoke frequently of **trustworthiness**, authenticity and a desire to build a business that valued principles and people over the short-termism of Wall Street.

​		So in March, when the coronavirus **hurtled** in, the **rupturing** of the "Airfam" was painful. Airbnb, which had been `on track` to go public this year, suddenly faced an **avalanche** of travel cancellations. Revenue evaporated. Weeks later, Chesky announced the **layoffs** and scaled back the company's ambitions.

### UK must prioritize leveling up if economy is to get back on its feet

​		Progress on the promises he made on the steps of Downing Street a year ago remain minimal. Leveling up is still no more than a phrase, social care is not fixed, Brexit is not done. Many voters would give the prime minister a pass on these issues during a global health emergency. But as the summer months provide distance from the initial shock, and as the government attempts to shift **gear** from crisis management to the recovery phase of the outbreak, patience will be tested.

### Senate confirms Barrett, delivering for Trump and reshaping the Court

​		It was the first time in 151 years that a justice was confirmed without the support of a single member of the minority party, a sign of how bitter Washington's war over judicial nominations has become.

​		Barrett, 48, was Trump's third nominee to the Supreme Court, but arrayed beneath her were 162 new district court judges and 53 appeals court judges who have been installed by Republicans over the past four years, roughly a third of the entire federal appellate bench.
