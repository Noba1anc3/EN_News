## UK must prioritize leveling up if economy is to get back on its feet

​		It would be normal after a year in power for a prime minister to lay it on thick about their achievements so far. But after four months of crisis inflicted by the pandemic, Boris Johnson’s achievements in the past year will always be colored by Covid-19.

​		Progress on the promises he made on the steps of Downing Street a year ago remain minimal. Leveling up is still no more than a phrase, social care is not fixed, Brexit is not done. Many voters would give the prime minister a pass on these issues during a global health emergency. But as the summer months provide distance from the initial shock, and as the government attempts to shift **gear** from crisis management to the recovery phase of the outbreak, patience will be tested.

​		Councils are at the eye of the storm in the recovery phase of the pandemic. Some places have been hit harder than others in the economic crash triggered by lockdown, and will require greater support. The prospect of local lockdown restrictions also means greater funding support is required in these areas. But a funding settlement from Westminster of sufficient scale has not been made.

​		Britain’s oldest economics research body NIESR warns that extreme levels of regional inequality can drag down the country’s overall economic growth. Repairing the damage was rising rapidly up the agenda before Covid-19, but since the onset of the crisis, it has taken on a new importance.

​		After a year with limited progress on his core promises, the coming months as Britain moves from crisis to recovery will need the prime minister to make sure the leveling-up agenda becomes more than just words.
