## As darker days approach, it's time to take seasonal depression seriously

​		"**Melancholy** occurs in autumn, whereas mania in summer, " wrote the Greek philosopher Posidonius around 100BC. The ancient Greeks were well aware of the toll that winter darkness could take on mood, as were ancient Chinese and Indian societies.

melancholy  忧伤; 忧郁的

​		Though seasonal **affective** disorder (Sad) was only named in the 1980s, the effects on mood of "**hideous** winter" — Shakespeare wasn't much of a fan either — long predate it.

affective  感情的; 情感的

hideous  十分丑陋的; 令人厌恶的

​		Anyone who gets Sad, or the winter blues, will be familiar with the **dread** that the change in seasons can bring. It comes around annually like clockwork, but this year presents extra challenges.

dread  恐惧; 害怕

​		"Sad is a huge problem at the best of times, and this is not the best of times, " said Norman Rosenthal, the doctor who named the disorder. He is concerned that people already suffering from the effects of a pandemic that has had a **dire** effect on mental health will find their unhappiness amplified during the coming shorter, darker days.

dire  可怕的; 危机的

​		There are of course things we can all do to mitigate a lack of sunlight, from diet and exercise to spending as much time outdoors as possible. And it's recommended that people with Sad make their homes as light and airy as possible, when so many people live in dark, **cramped** housing with small windows that hardly open and no outdoor space.

cramped  狭窄的; 拥挤的

​		Society needs a radical shift if we are to tackle many of the structural reasons for poor mental health. But we can start by taking Sad seriously. It may be a long cold lonely winter, but the ice will melt, and the sun will come.
