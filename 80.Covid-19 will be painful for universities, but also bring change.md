## Covid-19 will be painful for universities, but also bring change

​		In the normal run of things, late summer sees airports in the emerging world fill with nervous 18-year-olds, jetting off to begin a new life in the rich world's universities. The annual **trek** of more than 5m students is a triumph of globalization.

trek  长途跋涉

​		Yet with flights grounded and borders closed, this migration is about to become the pandemic's latest victim. Yet the disaster may have an upside. For many years government subsidies and booming demand have allowed universities to resist changes that could benefit both students and society. They may not be able to do so for much longer.

​		Until now most of them have resisted putting undergraduate courses online. Now change is being forced upon them. The College Crisis Initiative at Davidson College says that less than a quarter of American universities are likely to teach mostly or wholly in person next term.

​		Covid-19 is catalyzing innovation, too. The Big Ten Academic Alliance, a group of midwestern universities, is offering many of its 600, 000 students the opportunity to take online courses at other universities in the group. There is huge scope for using digital technology to improve education. Poor in-person lectures could be replaced by online ones from the best in the world, freeing up time for the small-group teaching which students value most.

​		Universities are rightly proud of their centuries-old traditions, but their ancient **pedigrees** have too often been used as an excuse for resisting change. If covid-19 shakes them out of their **complacency**, some good may yet come from this disaster.
