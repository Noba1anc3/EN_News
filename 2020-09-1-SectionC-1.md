​		It is not `controversial` to say that an unhealthy diet causes bad health. Nor are the basic elements of healthy eating disputed. Obesity raises **susceptibility** to cancer, and Britain is the sixth most obese country on Earth. That is a `public health emergency`. But naming the problem is the easy part. No one **disputes** the costs in quality of life and **depleted** health budgets of an obese population, but the quest for solutions gets **diverted** by ideological arguments around responsibility and choice. And the water is muddied by lobbying from the industries that profit from consumption of `obesity-inducing` products.

susceptibility  易受影响(或伤害等)的特性; 敏感性

disputes  争论; 对…提出质询

deplete  大量减少; 耗尽

divert  使绕道; 转移

​		`Historical precedent` suggests that science and politics can overcome `resistance from` businesses that pollute and poison but it `takes time`, and success often starts small. So it is **heartening** to note that a program in Leeds has achieved a reduction in childhood obesity, becoming the first UK city to reverse a fattening trend. The best results were among younger children and in more **deprived** areas. When 28% of English children aged two to 15 are obese, a national shift on the scale achieved by Leeds would lengthen hundreds of thousands of lives. A significant factor in the Leeds experience appears to be a scheme called HENRY,which helps parents reward behaviors that prevent obesity in children.

heartening  振奋人心的

deprived  贫穷的; 贫困的; 剥夺; 使丧失

​		Many members of parliament are uncomfortable even with their own government's `anti-obesity` strategy, since it involves a“`sugar tax`" and a ban on the sale of energy drinks to under-16s. Bans and taxes can be **blunt** instruments, but their harshest critics can rarely suggest better methods. These critics just oppose regulation itself.

blunt  不锋利的; 钝的

​		The relationship between poor health and inequality is too **pronounced** for governments to be passive about `large-scale` intervention. People living in the most deprived areas are four times more `prone to` die from avoidable causes than counterparts in more affluent places. As the structural nature of public health problems becomes harder to ignore, the complaint about overprotective government loses **potency**.

pronounced  显著的

potency  影响力

​		In fact, the `polarized debate` over public health interventions should have been abandoned long ago. Government action works when individuals are motivated to respond. Individuals need governments that expand access to good choices. The HENRY program was delivered in part through children's centers. Closing such centers and cutting council budgets doesn't magically increase reserves of individual `self-reliance`. The function of a `well-designed` state intervention is not to deprive people of liberty but to build social capacity and infrastructure that helps people `take responsibility for` their wellbeing. The obesity crisis will not have a solution devised by left or right ideology- -but experience indicates that the `private sector` needs the incentive of regulation before it starts taking public health emergencies seriously.
