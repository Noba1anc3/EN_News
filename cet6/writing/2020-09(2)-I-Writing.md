## Wealth of the Mind is the Only True Wealth

​		`There is a widespread saying that` wealth of the mind is the only true wealth, which informs us that **spiritual** richness should be **attached** great importance to.

​		`There is no denying that` `to a certain extent`, material wealth is **essential** for people to have a happy life. However, if a rich person is spiritually empty, his material wealth will not bring him true happiness or well-being. As for me, knowledge is an **invaluable** spiritual **treasure**. A wealth of knowledge will `broaden one's horizons` so that he can feel spiritually enriched and **satisfied**. In addition, strong **willpower** is **vital** spiritual wealth. No matter whether one is poor or rich, there will be **setbacks** in his life. Strong **willpower** `plays a crucial role in` supporting him to **overcome** difficulties and move on. Moreover, healthy values are also a valuable spiritual asset. With this wealth, one can follow a `moral code` `in the face of` **temptation** and make the right choice in stride.

​		All in all, spiritual wealth is more **precious** than any material treasure, which is the only true wealth for each of us.
