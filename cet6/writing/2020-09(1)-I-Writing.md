## What Is Worth Doing Is Worth Doing Well

​		`There is a famous saying`, "What is worth doing is worth doing well", which means if you think something is worth doing, you should go all out to do it well.

​		`First of all`, on the question "what is worth doing", people `are bound to` have different views, because they differ in their **outlook** on life and values. `As for me`, if you believe that doing something will help you improve yourself `to some extent`, that's what's worth doing. `Secondly`, once you decide to do something, you should do it well. If you do things **halfheartedly** not only will your chances of success be **slim**, but you won't have much **sense of accomplishment** even if you do succeed. `Thirdly`, doing things well is an **attitude** which `contributes to` your life development. Because once you `make up your mind` to get something done, you will try your best to **acquire** new knowledge, which will benefit you `in the future` even if you fail `in the end`.

​		Therefore, once you `set out to do` something, you should `take it seriously`, `let alone` do something worth doing.
