The lotus flower is one of the famous flowers in China, which is deeply loved by people. 

The lakes and ponds in many parts of China are hospitable for the lotus to grow. 

The lotus, which features bright color, blooms in the early morning and closes at night in summer with a flowering period of up to two to three months, attracting tourists across the country to **appreciate** it. 

The lotus has multiple functions. `Not only` can it green water and beautify courtyards, `but` it can also purify water, reduce pollution and improve the environment. 

The lotus does not fear the strong sunshine and comes out of the dirty mud unsoiled. `Therefore`, it is regarded as the symbol of purity and elegance and is often used as a **metaphor** for a person's noble character, making it a key theme in poetic and painting creation **throughout** history.

The places where the lotus is in full bloom are also **frequented** by many photography **enthusiasts**.
