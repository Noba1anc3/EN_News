## The Importance of Seizing the Moment

​		`There is a famous saying that` the best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today. It tells us that a **bright** future is **awaiting** us **only if** we can **seize** the moment and try our **utmost** to achieve our goals.

​		`Beyond doubt`, without taking action right now, a goal is only a wish. Without each step you move, you can never ever touch your goal. For a college student, **daydreaming** about scoring high in the CET-6 exam but making no efforts, failure is his only **destiny**. The same thing can be said of some **grown-ups** who aspire to gain **fame and fortune** but never **bother** to put their **splendid** plans right into actions.

​		Therefore, we must `keep in mind` that every effort today `paves your way forward`. To **pursue** our dreams, it is **imperative** for us to move ourselves into immediate action and do our utmost. Only in this way can we **fulfill** our dreams.
