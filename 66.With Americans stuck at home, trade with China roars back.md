## With Americans stuck at home, trade with China roars back

​		U.S. imports from China are surging as the year draws to a close, fueled by stay-at-home shoppers who are **snapping up** Chinese-made furniture and appliances, along with Barbie Dream Houses and bicycles for the holidays.

​		The surge in imports is another byproduct of the coronavirus, with Americans channeling money they might have spent on vacations, movies and restaurant dining to household items.

​		That has been a **boon** for China, the world's largest manufacturer of many of those goods. In November, China reported a record trade surplus of $75.43 billion, propelled by an unexpected 21.1% surge in exports compared with the same month last year. Leading the jump were exports to the United States, which climbed 46.1% to $51.98 billion, also a record.

​		That surge has **defied** the expectations of U.S. politicians, who earlier this year predicted that the pandemic would be a moment for reducing trade with China and bringing factories back to the United States.

​		But despite U.S. tariffs on more than $360 billion worth of China's imports, there is little sign that global supply chains are returning to the United States.

​		China employed lockdowns and surveillance to shake off the effects of the pandemic, allowing its factories to reopen at a large scale more quickly than businesses in the United States, where the disease is still running **rampant**.

​		"Overall, China's quick economic recovery and its dominance as a source for products that Americans have turned to during the pandemic have outweighed the dampening effect of Trump's tariffs, " said Mary E. Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.
