## The Uncle Roger controversy: Why people are outraged by a video about cooking rice

​		On July 8, Malaysian comedian Nigel Ng uploaded to YouTube a video titled "DISGUSTED by this Egg Fried Rice Video", under his comedic persona "Uncle Roger".In the video, Ng slammed BBC Food presenter Hersha Patel's unconventional way of cooking Chinese-style egg-fried rice, which included draining the rice through a **strainer** after boiling.

​		What Ng intended to be a comedic video sparked a firestorm of **dismay** and disbelief as it ricocheted around the internet, gaining more than 7 million views on YouTube and nearly 40 million on Twitter.

​		Many viewers **derided** Patel's methods for departing from how Chinese egg-fried rice is traditionally made. Patel hadn't washed the rice before boiling it. She had added too much water. She should have used day-old rice.

​		But the issue at hand goes beyond a difference in opinion on the varying methods of cooking rice.
Countless White chefs in recent years have been accused of cultural **appropriation** by creating food from other ethnic groups using methods and phrases that are deemed "unauthentic", disrespectful, and sometimes outright racist.

​		Last year, for instance, an Asian food critic accused celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay of tokenism, after he launched a restaurant described in promotional material as "an authentic Asian eating house".The restaurant didn't differentiate between wildly different and unique types of Asian cuisines, **lumping** them all together as generically Asian.

​		Food is not just sustenance, it carries history and heritage, which is why many people are deeply offended when these traditional methods of cooking are cast aside.
