## With announcement of trade deal, the end of Brexit is finally in sight

​		Britain and the European Union announced a post-Brexit trade deal Thursday after years of talks, in last-minute negotiations that lasted well into Christmas Eve, ahead of the country's formal break from the EU customs union and single market set for the night of Dec. 31.

​		Q: Why did it take so long to leave the EU?

​		A: There was no preexisting playbook for a country looking to drop out of the EU. Britain had to negotiate a withdrawal agreement spelling out the terms of its departure — in negotiation with a 26-nation bloc in which every government has a **veto**.

veto  否决权

​		To make matters worse, Britain's Supreme Court decided in January 2017 that Parliament must have a say on any Brexit deal. Theresa May tried to reach a compromise deal, but it was voted down in Parliament three times before she eventually **resigned**.

resign  辞职

​		Q: What aspects of Brexit have led to the biggest disagreements?

​		A: The sides clashed over fishing rights and other topics. The largest debate centered on the Irish border, across which seamless travel from Northern Ireland to Ireland and **vice versa** is permitted.

 vice versa  反之亦然

​		Q: What `long-term` effects might Brexit have?

​		A: Britain has struggled economically since the 2016 vote, but the effects of Brexit have been overshadowed by the pandemic. Likewise, Johnson's ambitious plans for a "Global Britain, " free of EU involvement, have sputtered amid a disaster that has killed more than 60, 000 people in the United Kingdom.

​		Most recent polls have revealed a nation divided, with most polls suggesting a small but consistent majority preferring to stay in the EU. Even as Brexit ends, the debate about it will continue.
