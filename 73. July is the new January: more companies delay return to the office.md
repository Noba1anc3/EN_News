## July is the new January: more companies delay return to the office

​		When the coronavirus pandemic shuttered offices around the United States in March, many companies told their employees that it would be only a short **hiatus** away from headquarters.

hiatus  间断; 停滞

​		Workers, they said, would be back in their cubicles within a matter of weeks. Weeks turned into September. Then September turned into January. And now, with the virus still surging in some parts of the country, a growing number of employers are delaying return-to-office dates once again, to the summer of 2021 at the earliest.

Google was one of the first to announce that July 2021 was its return-to-office date. Uber, Slack and Airbnb soon jumped on the bandwagon. In the past week, Microsoft, Target, Ford Motor and "The New York Times" said they, too, had postponed the return of in-person work to next summer and acknowledged the inevitable: The pandemic isn’t going away anytime soon.

​		More companies are also saying that they will institute permanent work-from-home policies. In May, Facebook was one of the first to announce that it would allow many employees to work remotely even after the pandemic. On Friday, Microsoft announced it would also be part of that shift.

​		Other companies that have delayed their returns to the office until next summer often face a complicated decision because their workforces are not just made up of white-collar engineers, unlike those of internet companies.

​		Ford said last week that its decision to hold off on back in-person office work through June 2021 would apply to its roughly 32, 000 employees in North America who are already working remotely. The company, which has about 188, 000 employees, said the policy does not apply to factory staff.
