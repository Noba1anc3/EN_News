## For women, the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg brings a particular grief

​		In Waco, Texas, Lily Coffman, 15, joined a small crowd of mostly mothers and daughters in a candlelight **vigil** at the county courthouse. There, they held an 87-second moment of silence — a second for each year of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's life.

​		For these women and so many others around the country, the loss of Ginsburg brought on a very particular kind of grief. It was not the grief of liberals **agonizing** over President Donald Trump's pronouncement that he intended to quickly fill the justice's seat and the possibility of long-term conservative domination of the Supreme Court, though there was plenty of that.

​		It was also the loss of an elder stateswoman of feminism, a powerhouse **octogenarian** who had become an unlikely icon to women of all ages.

​		As only the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court, Ginsburg burst into popular culture and became an internet sensation after a law student proclaimed her the Notorious R.B.G., a play on the nickname of a famous rapper.

​		"As women, it's not that we don't have role models, but role models like R.B.G. come along so very rarely, " said Jordan Jancosek, 31, an archivist at the Brown University library in Providence, Rhode Island.

​		"And it wasn't that she was a feminist icon and she did so much for women, " Jancosek went on, "but she understood that both men and women were being beholden to these restrictions and these ways that society had put on them, and she really took it on as her duty to turn that on its head."
