## A 5-story building in Shanghai 'walks' to a new location

​		Shanghai residents passing through the city's eastern Huangpu district earlier this month might have stumbled upon an unusual sight: a "walking" building.

​		An 85-year-old primary school has been lifted off the ground — in its entirety — and relocated using new technology dubbed the "walking machine."

​		In the city's latest effort to preserve historic structures, engineers attached nearly 200 mobile supports under the five-story building, according to Lan Wuji, chief technical supervisor of the project.

​		The supports act like robotic legs. They're split into two groups which alternately rise up and down, imitating the human stride. Attached sensors help control how the building moves forward, said Lan.

​		In recent decades, China's rapid modernization has seen many historic buildings **razed** to clear land for **gleaming** skyscrapers and office buildings. But there has been growing concern about the architectural heritage lost as a result of **demolition** across the country.

​		Shanghai has arguably been China's most progressive city when it comes to heritage preservation. The survival of a number of 1930s buildings in the famous Bund district and 19th-century "shikumen" (or "stone gate") houses in the renovated Xintiandi neighborhood have offered examples of how to give old buildings new life.

​		The city also has a track record of relocating old buildings. In 2018, the city relocated a 90-year-old building in Hongkou district, in what was then considered to be Shanghai's most complex relocation project to date.

​		The Lagena Primary School, which weighs 7, 600 tons, posed a new challenge — it's T-shaped, whereas previously relocated structures were square or rectangular, according to Xinhua.

​		Experts and technicians met to discuss possibilities and test a number of different technologies before deciding on the "walking machine, " Xinhua said.
