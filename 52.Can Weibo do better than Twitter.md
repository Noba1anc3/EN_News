## Can Weibo do better than Twitter

​		Three years after Twitter launched in 2006, Chinese techies created a similar microblogging service in China. Weibo (literally "microblog" in Chinese) boasted an average of 241m daily active users in March, more than Twitter. And like Twitter, it relies heavily on advertising revenue.

​		As coronavirus-induced uncertainty led advertisers to slash budgets, Weibo saw advertising revenue, which accounts for nearly 90% of sales, plunge. In the first quarter it fell by a fifth year on year, to $275m. Operating profit plummeted by more than half, to $58m.

​		Weibo also confronts a long-term challenge. Yujun Shao of Westwin, a Shanghai-based digital-marketing firm, notes that for much of the past decade two firms — Weibo and Tencent — sucked in the vast majority of advertising spending on Chinese social media.

​		Today the "big two" are competing for ad yuan with another **behemoth**, ByteDance, which operates Douyin, an addictive short-video app. Other rising internet stars, such as Pinduoduo, which offers bargain shopping, are also muscling in on the advertising market.

​		Weibo already boasts more than half a billion registered users in China. But user growth has slowed. To keep advertisers on board, Weibo must therefore boost user engagement.

​		It already sports a richer array of functions than Twitter. In 2018 it acquired Yizhibo, in which people live-stream stand-up comedy, moonwalks and other acts for tips. Last year it launched a photo-sharing service akin to Instagram called Oasis.

​		Still, Weibo's revenues per user have been declining since 2018, and its share price with them. That is one more feature it has in common with Twitter.
