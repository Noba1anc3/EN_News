## Inside the company at the forefront of China's push to develop a coronavirus vaccine

​		Inside the white, **sterile** walls of a new building on the southern **outskirts** of Beijing, two employees **donning** masks and rubber gloves are busy pipetting a clear, colorless liquid into rows of small vials.

​		The 215, 000 square feet production plant was built in recent months specifically for producing a Covid-19 vaccine developed by Chinese **pharmaceutical** company Sinovac Biotech.

​		CoronaVac, the vaccine candidate from Sinovac, is part of China's push to be at the forefront of rolling out **immunizations** against the deadly novel coronavirus.

immunization  免疫

​		The Nasdaq-listed biotech company began developing its vaccine in late January, less than a week after Wuhan — the original **epicenter** of China's coronavirus outbreak — went into a strict lockdown.

epicenter  震中; 中心

​		By June, China had largely contained the coronavirus, contending with only small, **sporadic** outbreaks. The small number of newly reported Covid-19 cases in China didn't meet the necessary conditions for a Phase 3 trial, so Sinovac reached an agreement with Brazil — which ranks second in the world for infections, with more than 3.6 million reported cases.

sporadic  偶发的

​		In collaboration with the Butantan Institute in São Paulo, a Phase 3 study was launched in late July involving 9, 000 volunteers, all health professionals who have worked with Covid-19 patients but haven't been infected with the virus.

​		The tests are ongoing, but Dimas Covas, president of the Butantan Institute, said Wednesday preliminary data shows CoronaVac induced immunity in 97% of the people vaccinated after two doses — a level he said was "fundamental to break the chain of transmission of the coronavirus."
