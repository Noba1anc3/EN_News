## Mall Santas brave the pandemic with lexiglass barriers, sanitation elves and snow-globe bubbles

​		Mall Santas brave the pandemic with plexiglass barriers, **sanitation** **elves** and snow-globe bubbles. This year's holiday photos will have a decidedly pandemic feel: No more sitting on Kriss Kringle's lap or whispering in his ear. Santa is hosting drive-through events, attaching face shields to his hat and trading in his white cloth gloves for disposable ones to protect himself — and others.

​		"Santa can't give out hugs or candy canes this year, but people still want to see him, " said Mark Brenneman, 70, who has been playing Santa for nearly five decades."They want hope. They want normal."

​		Bass Pro Shops began offering free photos with Santa during the 2008 recession, when the country was in need of a collective pick-me-up. It turned out to be an overnight success. Now the outdoors retailer is hoping to re-create some of that magic, even if Old Saint Nick is stuck behind an acrylic shield and elves are pulling double duty as "Santa's sanitization squad."

​		The SoNo Collection, a mall in Norwalk, Conn., is offering virtual visits this year for $25.But for those who would like to see Santa in the flesh, he'll be greeting shoppers from inside an acrylic snow globe on the third floor.

​		"Santa has survived so many things — the Spanish flu, the bubonic plague — and I just couldn't bring myself to tell my kids that he was afraid of covid-19, " said Kathryn Burgess, a photographer who designed the snow globe and spent $10, 000 manufacturing it."But we had to come up with a creative plan to protect him."

​		Her acrylic barriers, which she sells for as much as $4, 000, are being used by nearly 50 malls, schools and hospitals this holiday season.
