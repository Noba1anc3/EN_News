## Robot dolphins: the cruelty-free $20m 'animal' you can't tell from the real thing

​		Entrepreneurs in New Zealand are working with American creators of some of Hollywood's most famous creatures to develop **animatronic** dolphins that look almost identical to their living counterparts.

​		A robotic dolphin that can nod an answer to a child might sound unappealing or **disconcerting**. But as marine parks around the world face increasing pressure to abandon exhibitions featuring real whales and dolphins, the creatures provide an appealing alternative, their creators say.

​		But with a `price tag` of about NZ$40m (£20.8m) per dolphin, the biggest obstacle for the creators of the animatronic creatures is proving to potential clients that the robotic sea creatures will work out to be cheaper `in the long run` than the real thing.

​		Li Wang, a business developer for Edge Innovation, the New Zealand-based company making the case for the robots, said they do cost four times more than normal dolphins but would last longer.

​		Melanie Langlotz, one of the entrepreneurs behind the project said, the prototype for the dolphin is indiscernible from the real thing. A test audience had been unable to guess the dolphin was not real, she added.

​		Animal rights advocates also welcomed the change. They hoped robotic dolphins would replace real ones in marine parks worldwide.

​		In nature, dolphins swim up to 40 miles a day and live in **tight-knit** family groups, but in **captivity** animals were confined to concrete pools filled with chemically treated water and forced to interact with strangers.
