## As motorcade rolls by, Thai royal family glimpses the people's discontent

​		The cream-colored stretch Rolls-Royce **limousine** crawled past the angry crowds. The queen of Thailand smiled. But what Queen Suthida saw Wednesday may have been **sobering**.

motorcade  车队

limousine  豪华轿车

sobering  令人警醒的; 使人冷静的

​		Anti-government protesters yelled "my taxes!, " referring to their personal contributions to royal **coffers**. The police held them back but could not hide the demonstrators' **defiant** **salutes**.

coffer  金库; 资金

defiant  反抗的; 挑衅的

salute  敬礼

​		For months now, pro-democracy protesters have gathered by the thousands to call for reforms to the **monarchy** and military, influential institutions that have dominated Thailand's power structure for decades.

monarchy  君主制

​		But the royal limousine's route Wednesday was the first time that members of the nuclear royal family had gotten such a close look at the faces of Thais who are openly questioning the monarchy's **exalted** position in the country.

exalted  高贵的; 显赫的

​		Thailand is no ordinary **constitutional monarchy**. It is bound by some of the world's strictest lèse-majesté laws criminalizing criticism of the crown. When politicians are given an audience with the king, they typically **prostrate** themselves and crawl forward in a sideways **slither**.

prostrate  俯卧

slither  爬行; 滑行

​		But as the protest movement has strengthened over the past three months, taboos surrounding the monarchy have fallen in rapid succession.

​		The protest movement has woven together **disparate** **strands** of dissatisfaction, ranging from frustration with school uniform rules to anger at the lavish lifestyle of the king at a time when a coronavirus ban on international tourism has hit Thailand’s economy hard.

disparate  迥然不同的

strand  股; 缕

​		"We are going to fight for democracy, fight for freedom, fight for the equality of us as human beings, " a protest leader said Wednesday."We will not bow, prostrate, crawl ever again."
