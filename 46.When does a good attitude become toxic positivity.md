## When does a good attitude become toxic positivity

​		Between sleepless nights, **diapers** and feeding times, having small children at home could leave Priscilla Goins feeling exhausted. She loved her kids, but it was a lot.

diaper  尿布

​		"I would sometimes say 'I just want a minute to myself, '" Goins, of Knoxville, Tennessee, said."People would be like: 'Oh, you'll miss it when they're older.'" And that made her so mad.

​		It's not that she disagreed. But in those moments, she wanted acknowledgement that the exhaustion she was going through was **legitimate**. A focus on **upbeat** thinking, while **shunting** challenging and difficult experiences to the side, is what some experts call "toxic positivity."

legitimate  合理的; 合法的; 批准; 授权

upbeat  乐观的; 快乐的

shunt  转轨; 调往

​		It's not that being cheerful is a bad thing. A positive attitude can be a gift to those around you, said Jamie Long, a clinical psychologist, but it shouldn't take the place of listening thoughtfully to others' experiences.

​		"When you are choosing to look at situations from one perspective — in this case a positive perspective — you are very likely to dismiss or minimize an **authentic** experience, " Long explained. That's toxic positivity, which is what Goins received when she was looking for a bit of **commiseration** about the challenges of parenting young children.

authentic  真正的; 真实的

commiseration  同情

​		Even if you're trying to cheer up someone, diminishing someone's difficult experiences can leave them feeling they should hide negative feelings in the future. Instead of trying to find a positive spin, Long suggested using accepting, validating language.

​		"Sometimes we just need to say 'Yeah, me too, ' or 'That makes total sense, '" Long said."It's allowing someone to express something that's authentic, even if it's uncomfortable or even if it's hard to hear."
