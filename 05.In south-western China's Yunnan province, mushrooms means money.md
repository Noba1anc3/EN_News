## In south-western China's Yunnan province, mushrooms means money

​		In May, when the first **monsoon** rains sweep across the mountainous province of Yunnan, foragers **throng** to damp forests to hunt for `wild mushrooms`.

throng  群集

​		Thousands of Yunnanese families `earn much of their living` from the wild-fungi season, which runs until October. The 160, 000 tonnes they collect annually generate income of about 10bn yuan ($1.4bn).The most valuable end up on **posh** dinner plates abroad, from porcini — beloved of Europeans — to meaty matsutake, prized by South Koreans and Japanese. Trains are commandeered to get the mushrooms from basket to banquet in under 30 hours. A rail service launched last year has been dubbed the "high-speed matsutake express".Whatever is not sold fresh is air-dried, frozen or made into a **relish**.

​		Yunnan `accounts for` just 4% of China's land area yet is home to more than 800 of the country's 1, 000 known edible varieties of mushrooms, and about one third of the world's. Dozens more are discovered in Yunnan every year, says Yang Zhuliang of the Kunming Institute of Botany.

​		Some are **lethal**. A type identified in 2012 is called "little white" because of its resemblance to an **innocuous** oyster mushroom. Mr Yang's institute named it as the culprit behind Yunnan Unknown Cause Sudden Death Syndrome, which for decades had haunted villagers during the monsoon. Little whites now feature on billboards at wet markets in the region that show how to **discern** the **delectable** from the deadly.
