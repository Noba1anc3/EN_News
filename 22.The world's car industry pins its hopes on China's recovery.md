## The world's car industry pins its hopes on China's recovery

​		Now — more than ever — China is the focus of the hopes of automakers around the globe. Sales of passenger cars in Asia's largest economy have increased for two months, while the other major markets have continued to shrink, with Europe **slumping** 18% in August. And China is set to be the first to bounce back to 2019 volume levels, albeit as late as 2022, according to researchers including S&P Global Ratings.

slump  骤降；猛跌

​		China's importance is boosted by its focus on nurturing the electric-car ecosystem. The government wants new-energy vehicles to account for 15% or more of the market in 2025.
​		And carmakers are pouring money into China to prepare for the **seismic** change. Tesla's multibillion-dollar factory in Shanghai, its first outside the U.S., began deliveries around the start of 2020. Volkswagen said in May it will become the biggest shareholder of Guoxuan High-Tech to help secure critical battery supplies as it ramps up EV production.

seismic  地震的；重大的

​		But locals aren't giving up easily. A **petite** electric car that sells for less than $5, 000 helped SAIC-GM-Wuling last month snatch the title of the best-selling EV maker from Tesla. Shares of local contender NIO Inc. have surged this year after it secured more funding. Li Auto Inc. raised $1.1 billion in late July, while XPeng had a strong stock-market debut last month.

petite  纤弱的；娇小的

​		Challenges remain: China's economy is still **recuperating**, and the quickly developing EV market may be prompting some buyers to **put off** purchase decisions until more models have come out and proven their reliability. But the odds for China's car market to thrive are still better than for other regions.

recuperate  恢复；康复

put off  推迟；推延
