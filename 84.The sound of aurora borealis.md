## The sound of aurora borealis

​		What sound does the solar system make? To capture this **celestial** soundtrack, "Songs of the Sky", an episode from BBC Radio 3's "Between the Ears" strand, takes a winter journey through central Alaska. The program shows how a wildlife **ranger** and a hi-tech composer collaborated to create otherworldly music out of the Northern Lights, or **aurora** **borealis**.

celestial  天空的; 神仙;（指封建时代的）中国人; 天朝之人

ranger  护林员

​		Karin Lehmkuhl Bodony, a Native Alaskan, is a biologist for the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Matthew Burtner, another Alaskan, is a composer, sound artist and "eco-**acoustician**".He uses computer technology to transform natural processes into the serendipitous sounds that enrich his compositions. The **spooky** **alchemy** of transforming light into sound begins with the (very) low-frequency radio recorder Ms Lehmkuhl carries into the forests as she observes the Northern Lights.

acoustic  声音的；听觉的

spooky  怪异吓人的; 阴森可怖的

alchemy  炼金术; (改变事物的)神秘力量，魔力

​		So what does the solar system sound like? It **whistles** and it **whoops**. It **crackles** and it **chirps**. It **gurgles**, **chatters**, squeaks and flows in liquid waves of sound. Ms Lehmkuhl likens it to "listening to whales underwater". Mr Burtner feeds this auditory fingerprint into the eerily **meditative** music listeners later hear.

whistle  吹口哨

whoop  高喊

crackle  发爆裂声，噼啪作响

chirp  吱喳叫

gurgle  潺潺流水声; 咯咯声

chatter  喋喋不休; 打颤

meditative  沉思的

​		For him, such projects are a reminder of the "system of order in the solar system" now disrupted on Earth by human actions that have led to planet-threatening climate change. Circumpolar peoples, Native Alaskans among them, have already seen their customs and **livelihoods** **imperiled** by the scrambled seasons and retreating ice. Mr Burtner's music echoes the ancient harmonies of this world and alerts listeners to its new fragility.

livelihood  生计

imperil  使陷于危险; 危及
