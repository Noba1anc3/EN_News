​		Triple-digit temperatures have spread over much of the state, including a record-high of 125℉ (52℃) in Death Valley on Saturday. Los Angeles County registered 121℉ (49℃) on Sunday afternoon, a record for the National Weather Service office that covers the metropolitan area.

​		The heat, coupled with a forecast of possible dry, **gusty** winds, has made for dangerous weekend fire weather, at a time when nearly 13, 000 firefighters are currently battling to contain nearly two dozen major fires around California.

​		A wildfire that broke out near Shaver Lake in the Sierra National Forest prompted evacuation orders Saturday. That blaze, called the Creek fire, has burned 45, 000 acres, trapping at least 150 people near a reservoir in Fresno county and injuring dozens who had to be airlifted to the hospital.

​		The weather service predicted "brutally hot" temperatures through Monday as a high pressure system perches over the western US. Heat warnings were also in effect in Arizona and Nevada.

​		The heatwave also poses significant challenges for the state's large homeless population, with thousands living outside in encampments and cars and other **makeshift** living quarters.

​		"When it's 105℉ and you're living in a **creek** bed in a tent, it's a lot of health issues out there. It's a formula for disaster, " said Scott Wagers, pastor and founder of the CHAM **Deliverance** Ministry.
