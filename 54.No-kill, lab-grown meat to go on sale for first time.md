## No-kill, lab-grown meat to go on sale for first time

​		**Cultured** meat, produced in bioreactors without the slaughter of an animal, has been approved for sale by a regulatory authority for the first time. The development has been **hailed** as a landmark moment across the meat industry.

​		The "chicken bites", produced by the US company Eat Just, have passed a safety review by the Singapore Food Agency.

​		Dozens of firms are developing cultivated chicken, beef and pork, with a view to slashing the impact of industrial **livestock** production on the climate and nature crises, as well as providing cleaner, drug-free and cruelty-free meat. Currently, about 130 million chickens are slaughtered every day for meat, and 4 million pigs.

​		The cells for Eat Just's product are grown in a 1, 200-litre bioreactor and then combined with plant-based ingredients. The product would be significantly more expensive than conventional chicken until production was scaled up, but Eat Just said it would ultimately be cheaper.

​		The companies developing lab-grown meat believe this is the product most likely to **wean** committed meat-eaters off traditional sources. Josh Tetrick, of Eat Just, said: "My hope is this leads to a world in the next handful of years where the majority of meat doesn’t require killing a single animal."

​		But he said major challenges remained, with the reaction of consumers to cultured meat perhaps being the most significant. Other challenges included getting regulatory approval in other nations and increasing production.

​		A recent report from the global consultancy AT Kearney predicted that most meat in 2040 would not come from dead animals. The firm's Carsten Gerhardt said: "In the long run we are convinced that cultured meat will address the health and environmental impact issues that traditional meat has when produced in a highly industrialized way."
