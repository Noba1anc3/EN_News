## Rat that sniffs out land mines receives award for bravery

​		The medal awarded Friday **lauded** the "lifesaving bravery and devotion to duty" for work detecting land mines in Cambodia. Its recipient: a rat named Magawa.

laud  赞扬; 赞美

​		Not since the **fictional** Remy of the 2007 Disney-Pixar film "Ratatouille" has a rat done so much to challenge the public's view of the animals as creatures more commonly seen scuttling through **sewers** and the subway: Magawa has discovered 39 land mines and 28 pieces of unexploded ordnance, and helped clear more than 1.5 million square feet of land over the past four years.

​		More than 5 million land mines have been laid in Cambodia during the internal conflicts in the 1980s and 1990s. Parts of the country are also littered with unexploded ordnance dropped in U.S. airstrikes during the Vietnam War.

​		Magawa is part of the "Hero Rat" initiative, which works across South East Asia and Africa, training rats to save lives by detecting land mines.

​		Magawa was trained to detect TNT, the chemical compound within explosives. The ability to sniff out TNT makes him much faster than any person in searching for land mines, as he can ignore scrap metal that would usually be picked up by a metal detector.

​		Unlike humans, Magawa is too light to **detonate** a mine, so there is minimal risk of injury.
Described by Malen, his main **handler**, as friendly and hard working, Magawa has a work-life balance that is likely the **envy** of many a human.

​		When he is not in the minefield, the 2-foot-long rat likes snacking on bananas, peanuts and watermelons, and taking a spin on the running wheel.
