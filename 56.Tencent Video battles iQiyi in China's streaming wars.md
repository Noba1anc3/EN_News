## Tencent Video battles iQiyi in China's streaming wars

​		Launched in 2010, iQiyi has grown used to the foreign press calling it "the Netflix of China".But Gong Yu, iQiyi's founder and boss, insists that his firm is more accurately described as "Netflix plus".

​		Unlike Netflix, which relies almost entirely on subscription fees, iQiyi has multiple revenue streams."Membership fees", which start from 19.8 yuan ($2.87) a month, accounted for just over half of iQiyi's 7.4bn yuan in revenues in the second quarter. The rest came mainly from an online store (which sells "entertainment-related merchandise"), a **nascent** mobile-gaming arm, an e-book business and advertisements.

​		Mr Gong is battling Tencent Video, part of the eponymous technology conglomerate. It overtook iQiyi at the end of June with 114m video subscribers to iQiyi's 105m.

​		The rivalry between Tencent Video and iQiyi is a proxy war between **mighty** Tencent and fading Baidu, a search firm that is iQiyi's majority owner. Indeed, iQiyi seemed to concede as much in its latest annual report, writing that "competitors include well-capitalized companies that are capable of offering compensation packages more attractive to talents."

mighty  巨大的; 强有力的

​		Still, as Westerners who pay for a few video subscriptions can **attest**, streaming is not a zero-sum game. Gigi Zhou of BOCOM International, a **broker**, reckons the Chinese market will soon be big enough to sustain both iQiyi and Tencent Video.

​		Ms Zhou expects 400m Chinese to subscribe to video-streaming platforms by 2023, up from some 300m in 2019. So long as no new rival emerges, each firm could capture around 150m, helping them spread costs over more subscribers and so turn a profit.
