## Five trends to watch in the coming year

​		The number 21 is connected with luck, risk, taking chances and rolling the **dice**. All of which seems strangely appropriate for a year of unusual uncertainty. As 2021 approaches, here are some trends to watch in the year ahead.

1 Fights over vaccines.

​		As the first vaccines become available in quantity, the focus will shift from the heroic effort of developing them to the equally **daunting** task of distributing them. Vaccine diplomacy will accompany fights within and between countries over who should get them and when.

daunting  令人望而生畏的

2 A mixed economic recovery.

​		As economies bounce back from the pandemic the recovery will be **patchy**, as local outbreaks and **clampdowns** come and go — and governments **pivot** from keeping companies on life-support to helping workers who have lost their jobs.

clampdown  严禁；禁止

pivot  支点；中心

3 A less **footloose** world.

​		Tourism will shrink and change shape, with more emphasis on domestic travel. Airlines, hotel chains and aircraft manufacturers will struggle, as will universities that rely heavily on foreign students.

4 An opportunity on climate change.

​		One silver lining amid the crisis is the chance to take action on climate change, as governments invest in green recovery plans to create jobs and cut emissions. How ambitious will countries' reduction pledges be at the UN climate conference, delayed from 2020?

5 The year of déjà vu.
		That is just one example of how the coming year may feel, in many respects, like a second take on 2020, as events including the Olympics, the Dubai Expo and many other political, sporting and commercial gatherings do their best to open a year later than planned.
