## Giant pandas roll in horse manure to keep warm, study finds

​		Giant pandas have been seen **smearing** themselves with horse **manure** in the wild, and the sweet smell of scat isn't the only reason — it appears the manure helps them tolerate low temperatures, according to a study.

​		Unlike insects that make a **beeline** for **faeces**, digging for **olfactory** cues to locate food, attraction to **excrement** across mammal species is rare. But researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences observed that a giant panda subspecies in China's Qinling Mountains tended to seek out and sniff fresh horse manure and then roll over it.

​		The researchers set up infrared cameras in the wild between July 2016 to June 2017 and captured 38 events of this rolling behavior, which mostly occurred when the **ambient** temperature was less than 15C.

​		The behavior also appeared to be linked to **droppings** that were less than 10 days old. When the scientists compared fresh manure to older excrement, they found that the fresh faeces was rich in two compounds: beta-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide.

​		Dr. Simon Girling, the head vet at Edinburgh zoo, which houses the UK's only two giant pandas, said the study was insightful given that most research papers focus heavily on olfaction and **pheromones** in faeces.

​		"It starts to unlock our understanding of the biology of this particular species and how it can adapt, " he said.

​		He cautioned that horse faeces could carry salmonella bacteria."But potentially if it was possible to isolate these compounds in a safe way, that may well be something that could be used as an enrichment tool."
