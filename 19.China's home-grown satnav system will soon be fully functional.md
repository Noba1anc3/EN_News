## China's home-grown satnav system will soon be fully functional

​		Thirty-five thousand kilometers above the island of Borneo, the final piece of a Chinese infrastructure project is floating into place. The satellite is the last to join the BeiDou navigation system. The state-owned firm that launched it from Sichuan province on June 23rd says the network of BeiDou satellites will function fully around the end of July. It marks the end of the country's dependence on America for provision of a vital service: location data.
​		America's Global Positioning System (GPS) was the earliest satellite-navigation network to provide global coverage, so GPS-enabled devices became the norm for use by Chinese companies, citizens and soldiers. The system is owned by America's government and operated by its air force, which means American officials could decide to switch off or degrade the signals coming from GPS satellites. The main purpose of building BeiDou, which is operated by China's space administration, is to give China full control over a navigation system it can rely on.

​		Work on BeiDou began in 1993 and has involved three phases. The first two provided coverage in China and then across the rest of the Asia-Pacific region. The third phase provides global coverage. The completion of BeiDou not only eliminates dependency on America. It also puts China ahead technologically. BeiDou's satellites are more advanced than those of GPS. In the Asia-Pacific, BeiDou claims accuracy to 10cm, compared with 30cm offered by GPS.

​		China hopes to cash in on BeiDou globally. In December officials said China had exported BeiDou-enabled products to 120 countries and regions worldwide.
