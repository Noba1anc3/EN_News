## Winter Olympics prompts skiing construction boom in China

​		Weaving down a steep slope, snowboarder Zhang Xu **skied** gracefully to a halt in a shower of white powder — one of a new generation of Chinese people learning winter sports in brand new indoor facilities.

​		"I fell in love with the sport, " said 25-year-old Zhang, who started coming to the Sunac Snow Centre in Chengdu in July, the same month it opened."Skiing used to be a relatively small sport in China but now it's more popular, and the credit for that is down to the Winter Olympics."

​		The 2022 Beijing Winter Games have inspired a boom in construction of snow resorts; their numbers have rocketed nearly fourfold, fueled by demand from China's swelling middle class. Nearly 21 million people visited one last year, as the ability to spend more on leisure activities grows — average national disposable income has increased four times over the last two decades.

​		In provinces such as southwestern Sichuan, known for its hot and humid summers, there are plenty of mountains but little snow, so the best way for locals to learn to ski is inside.

​		"We are the first indoor ski resort in southwest China, " said Liu Jia, manager of the Sunac Snow Centre. At 80, 800 square metres, the snow park is the largest of its kind in the world — though one in Shanghai, **slated** to open in the next 18 months, could eclipse that.

​		China has grand plans for this **burgeoning** interest — it has previously said it wants to put 10 percent of the world's most populous nation on skis ahead of the 2022 Games. That's a figure so large it would double the current global tally of skiers.
