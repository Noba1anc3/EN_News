## Apple enters 5G race with new iPhone 12 range

​		Apple Inc on Tuesday launched its next-generation iPhone 12, with faster 5G connectivity that the California company hopes will spur consumers to **trade in** their old phones and keep its sales booming through the end of the year.

trade in  以旧换新

​		The new products will test whether Apple can ride a wave of consumer excitement around 5G wireless data networks, whose speediest variants **outstrip** their predecessors' data rates multiple times over.

outstrip  胜过; 超越

predecessor  前任

​		But whether iPhone buyers see a dramatic speed boost will depend heavily on where they are and which carrier they use.

​		Apple said all iPhone 12 models in the United States will support millimeter wave 5G, the fastest variant of the technology, as well as lower-frequency bands.

​		Outside of the United States, however, iPhones will lack millimeter wave **compatibility**, even in countries like Australia and South Korea where carriers are planning to roll out versions of the millimeter wave technology. Like some cheaper Android devices, iPhone 12 models in those countries will only support lower-frequency versions of 5G.

compatibility  兼容; 并存

​		Apple may face a **lukewarm** holiday season due to the coronavirus pandemic, said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma."As the **convergence** of flu season with COVID and colder weather forces everyone indoors, I think it's going to be harder to sell iPhones this Christmas. As much as Apple is a technology company, it's not known for its online sales, it's known for its in-store experience, " Dollarhide said.

lukewarm  温和的; 不热情的

convergence  融合; 趋同

​		Shares of Apple fell over 3% during the event, erasing $77 billion worth of stock market value, and closed down 2.7%.
