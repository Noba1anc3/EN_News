​		Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) MPs from both houses of parliament and representatives from **prefectural** party chapters voted overwhelmingly for Suga, with the Abe loyalist emerging from the poll on Monday with 377 of the 534 votes, well ahead of Fumio Kishida, a former foreign minister, and Shigeru Ishiba, a former defence minister.

prefectural  地方的; 县的

​		Suga, who has been the public face of the Abe administration during almost eight years as the government's top spokesman, will officially become prime minister after the LDP-controlled lower and upper houses vote on his appointment on Wednesday.

​		Suga will be confronted with issues Abe failed to address during his long period in office, including Japan's ageing population, low birthrate and poor record on gender equality.

​		Suga is widely seen as the Abe continuity candidate, a label he did little to **dispel** during his leadership bid. His **predecessor's** economic policy — a combination of huge government spending, ultra-easy monetary policy and structural reforms — would remain untouched, he said ahead of the vote.
