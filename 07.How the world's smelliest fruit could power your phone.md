## How the world's smelliest fruit could power your phone

​		Lithium-ion batteries power many of the **gadgets** we use today — from smartphones and laptops to electric toothbrushes and handheld vacuum cleaners.

​		But as we know from our phones that hold less and less juice the older they are, lithium-ion batteries have their limitations. In extremely hot or cold weather, their performance also falls. And there are also concerns around the safety and sustainability of lithium-ion batteries. Mining the metals needed for them comes with a high social and environmental cost.

​		This has spurred scientists around the world to try and develop new types of battery that can overcome these problems. One innovative group are not only trying to find new ways to power our devices, but also tackle the issue of food waste at the same time.

​		Vincent Gomes, a chemical engineer at the University of Sydney, and his team, including Labna Shabnam, are turning waste from the world's smelliest fruit, durian, and the world's largest fruit, jackfruit, into a supercapacitor that can charge mobile phones, tablets and laptops within minutes.

​		They heated, freeze-dried and then baked the inedible **spongey** core of each fruit in an oven at temperatures of more than 1, 500C (2732F). The black, highly **porous**, ultralight structures they were left with could then be fashioned into electrodes of a low-cost supercapacitor. The supercapacitors can be charged in 30 seconds, and could be used to power a range of devices.

​		The researchers' dream is to use these sustainable supercapacitors to store electricity from renewable energy sources for use in vehicles and houses.
