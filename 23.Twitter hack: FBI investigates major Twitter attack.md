## Twitter hack: FBI investigates major Twitter attack

​		The FBI has launched an investigation after hackers hijacked Twitter accounts of a number of `high-profile` US figures in an apparent Bitcoin **scam**."The accounts appear to have been compromised" to **perpetrate** cryptocurrency fraud, said the bureau, urging the public to be **vigilant**.

​		Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Joe Biden were among those hit in what Twitter said was a "co-ordinated" attack. Their official accounts requested donations in the cryptocurrency.

​		"Everyone is asking me to give back, " said a tweet from the account of Mr Gates, the Microsoft founder."You send $1, 000, I send you back $2, 000."

​		The BBC reported from a security source that a web address — cryptoforhealth.com — to which some hacked tweets directed users was registered by a cyber-attacker using the email address mkeyworth5@gmail.com.

​		"Cryptoforhealth" is also a registered user name on Instagram, apparently set up **contemporaneously** to the hack. The Instagram profile also posted a message that said: "It was a charity attack. Your money will find its way to the right place."

​		In any case, the real identities of the perpetrators are as yet unknown.

​		In the short time it was online, the link displayed in the tweets of targeted accounts received hundreds of contributions totaling more than $100, 000, according to publicly available blockchain records.

​		Dr Drew, who co-authored a paper warning about the potential of Twitter being used to sow `disinformation`, said the latest incident highlighted the need for all major social media platforms to check their security measures, particularly in the run up to the US presidential vote in November.
