## The dawn of digital medicine

​		McKinsey estimates that global digital-health revenues will rise from $350bn last year to $600bn in 2024. The groundwork for what looks **poised** to be the next trillion-dollar business has been accelerated by the pandemic.

poised  准备好的; 蓄势待发

​		Patients are keen. A study of some 16m American ones just reported in JAMA Internal Medicine, a journal, found that their use of telemedicine surged 30-fold between January and June.

​		Critically, regulators around the world are pressing health-care providers to open up their siloed systems — a **precondition** for digital health to flourish. The EU is promoting an electronic standard for medical records. 

precondition  前提

​		In August the Indian government unveiled a plan for a digital health identity with interoperability at its core.

​		All this is helping medicine evolve from "a clinical science supported by data to a data science supported by clinicians", argues Pamela Spence of EY, a consultancy. Does this make health care big tech's for the taking?

​		Tech giants' earlier **forays** into health care flopped, argues Shubham Singhal of McKinsey, because they had gone it alone. Medicine is a regulatory minefield where big tech's business models, particularly the ad-supported sort, are not a natural fit. But the pandemic has also highlighted that existing providers' **snazzy** hardware and pricey services too seldom **genuinely** improve health outcomes.

foray  尝试; 突袭

snazzy  漂亮的; 时髦的

genuinely  由衷地; 真诚地

​		That points to a hybrid future where Silicon Valley works more closely with traditional health-care firms. Dr Klasko, chief executive of Jefferson Health, is embracing the hybrid approach with Gusto."You must have partnerships with providers, not just hundreds of unconnected apps."
