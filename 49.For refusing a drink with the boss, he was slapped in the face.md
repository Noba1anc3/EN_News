## For refusing a drink with the boss, he was slapped in the face

​		The new guy did not drink.

​		During a company dinner in Beijing on Thursday, his boss at Xiamen International Bank demanded that he order an alcoholic beverage. When he refused, another executive slapped him.

​		It was the **slap** heard around the country, prompting broad reflection on a professional drinking culture in China that rewards excessive drinking and **alienates** those who do not **imbibe**.

slap  拍; 打

alienate  使疏远; 离间

imbibe  喝酒; 吸收

​		"If certain 'cultures' or '**rituals**' come at the expense of health and mortality, can you still call it 'culture?' "Xu Chao, a medical doctor, wrote in a widely shared blog post after the episode went public.

ritual  礼节; 习惯

​		Around the globe, alcohol has long been seen as a way for workers to **bond**, as a **catalyst** for business deals and as a vital **lubricant** for professional connections.

bond  纽带; 联系

catalyst  催化剂

lubricant  润滑剂

​		Yang Wenzhan, a lawyer in Beijing, wrote in a blog post Monday: "If you say you don't want to drink, that can provoke some people. But if you give in and say you'll drink a little, then you've surrendered your line of defense."

​		But the lawyer, who is **abstinent**, said he had never been **coerced** into drinking against his will. Many social crowds are formed based on drinking habits, he noted, and dinner banquets can be divided into two tables: one for those who love to drink and another for those who do so moderately or not at all.

abstinent  节制的; 禁欲的

coerce  强迫; 胁迫

​		"If you can drink and make professional connections, that will help, " he wrote."But if you don't have this ability, you can still make a good lawyer."
