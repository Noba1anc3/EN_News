## China has 8 million blind people, but only 200 guide dogs

​		According to state broadcaster CCTV, China only had some 200 guide dogs in service as of April — which makes them even rarer than the giant pandas. The service dogs' **scarcity** is all the more striking considering the large number of people who could potentially benefit from their help. According to the World Health Organization, eight million Chinese are completely blind — roughly equal to the whole population of Switzerland.

​		Founded in 2006, the Dalian China Guide Dog Training Center was the first of its kind in China. Wang Jingyu, an animal behavior expert, decided to train China's own guide dogs after noticing that, unlike their Western counterparts, blind Chinese athletes did not have guide dogs to help them during the 2004 Athens **Paralympic** Games.

​		The puppies — mostly Golden Retrievers and Labradors, chosen for their gentle, friendly nature — are first sent to foster families for a year to learn to live with humans, before returning to the center for another year of professional training. Along the way, about 60% of the dogs will be disqualified and put up for adoption as pet dogs. The causes for disqualification can include showing aggression, having excessive energy, being overly sensitive to pressure, and suffering from car sickness.

​		The lack of funding is a key constraint for China's guide dog schools. In 2010, the Dalian government started to subsidize the center with 60, 000 yuan ($9, 106) for each guide dog it trains. The center also receives donations from the public, but they're often not enough to cover the cost — currently, it faces a 30% budget deficit.
