## Huge cat found etched into desert among Nazca Lines in Peru

​		The dun sands of southern **Peru**, **etched** `centuries ago` with geoglyphs of a hummingbird, a monkey, an orca — and a figure some would **dearly** love to believe is an astronaut — have now revealed the form of an enormous cat **lounging** across a desert hillside.

​		The feline Nazca line, dated to between 200BC and 100BC, emerged during work to improve access to one of the hills that provides a natural **vantage point** from which many of the designs can be seen.

​		A Unesco world heritage site since 1994, the Nazca Lines, which are made up of hundreds of **geometric** and zoomorphic images, were created by removing rocks and earth to reveal the contrasting materials below.

​		"The figure was **scarcely** visible and `was about to` disappear because it's situated on quite a steep slope that's **prone** to the effects of `natural erosion`, " Peru's culture ministry said in a statement this week.

​		It said the cat was 37 metres long, with well-defined lines that varied in width between 30cm and 40cm. Johny Isla, Peru's chief **archaeologist** for the lines, said between 80 and 100 new figures had emerged over recent years in the Nazca and Palpa valleys, all of which predated the Nazca culture (AD200-700)."These are smaller in size, drawn on to hillsides, and clearly belong to an earlier tradition."

​		The archaeologist said the cat had been put out during the late Paracas era, which ran from 500BC to AD200."We know that from comparing iconographies, " said Isla."Paracas textiles, for example, show birds, cats and people that are easily comparable to these geoglyphs."
