## Pro-choice protesters march in Polish cities amid abortion ban anger

​		Pro-choice protesters marched in cities across Poland on Friday amid `public anger` over a ruling banning almost all abortion in the country.

​		Poland already has some of the most **draconian** abortion laws in Europe, and on Thursday a constitutional **tribunal** ruled that one of the few exceptions to the ban — cases of severe **foetal** **impairment** — should also be made illegal. These cases, which hardline Catholic anti-abortion activists have called "**eugenic** abortion", made up almost all of the few abortions performed legally in Poland.

foetal  胎儿的

impairment  缺陷; 障碍

eugenic  优生的

​		The constitutional tribunal found that abortion in cases where "**prenatal** tests or other medical indications indicate a high probability of severe and irreversible foetal impairment or an incurable `life-threatening` disease" is a violation of the `constitutional right` to life.

prenatal  孕期的; 产前的

​		Each year, thousands of Polish women seeking abortions are forced to travel to neighboring countries. In previous years, attempts to tighten the already strict legislation led to a huge protest movement, with tens of thousands of women dressed in black marching through major Polish cities. Surveys showed that while society was split on liberalizing abortion, only a small minority backed a further tightening of the rules.

​		"The consequences will involve more human tragedies and the rapid growth of `abortion underground`, " said Zuzanna Rudzińska-Bluszcz, a candidate for the office of Poland's human rights ombudsman.

​		"The judgment will adversely affect the most vulnerable groups, and `in all likelihood`, will divide Poland even further, " she added.
