## India's economy shrinks by a quarter as covid-19 gathers pace

​		The statistics landed like fists in a one-two punch. First came the news that India had counted 78, 000 new cases of covid-19 on August 30th alone — more than any other country has tallied in a single day since the pandemic began. The next day came the bill for the two-month lockdown that the government imposed in late March at only four hours' notice.

​		The National Statistical Office said that India's output between April and June was 23.9% lower than in the same period the year before. No other big economy has shrunk so much during the pandemic.

​		In **hindsight**, India's government may have locked down too soon. The country had detected barely 600 cases of covid-19 by March. The ban on commercial activity and movement outside of the home was nearly total for two months. Around 140m people were thrown out of work. Millions **trudged** on foot to ancestral villages.

trudge  缓慢的走; 徒步跋涉

​		The pain was so great that hardly anyone can stomach the thought of reimposing strict controls, even though infections are rising more swiftly than ever. An **edict** declares that state and municipal governments may no longer impose stricter rules than the central government.

edict  命令; 法令

​		Many in India are growing **stoical** about the virus's spread. The national media are once again full of celebrity **tittle-tattle**. When Pranab Mukherjee, a former president, died on August 31st, the government declared a seven-day period of **mourning**. That he had been on a **ventilator** suffering from covid-19 for the last three weeks of his life was barely mentioned.
