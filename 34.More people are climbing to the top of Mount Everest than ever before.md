## More people are climbing to the top of Mount Everest than ever before

​		Scaling Mount Everest was once a feat reserved for only the bravest mountaineers. These days even relatively inexperienced alpinists attempt the climb.

​		Even elderly thrill-seekers now have a shot at reaching the top of the world. Twenty years ago, climbers in their 60s had just a one-in-eight chance of reaching Everest's summit; now the odds are closer to one in three.

​		The **fortunes** of first-time Everest climbers have improved **in tandem with** the rise of the commercial climbing business. In the 1990s experienced guides began leading groups of more **novice** climbers who, hitherto, might have gone it alone. Today more than 24 companies offer the service. Everest enthusiasts with little climbing experience can shell out tens of thousands of dollars to have their hands held most of the way up.

fortune  运气; 巨款; 命运

in tandem with  与...协作; 配合

novice  新手; 初学者

​		Better weather forecasting has helped, too. Traveling from the base camp to the top of the mountain takes around four days, and success depends heavily on weather conditions along the way. Spotting a suitable "window" of good climbing weather was tricky 30 years ago. As technology has advanced, forecasting has vastly improved.

​		Some old hands **fret** that, now that the journey to the peak is easier, Everest is becoming overcrowded with inexperienced mountaineers. The 2019 season was a perfect case in point. On May 23rd, 396 climbers attempted to reach the summit in one day. The result was a long queue along a **ridge** in the "death zone" near the top, which might have contributed to the death of some of the eleven climbers who **perished** that month.

fret  苦恼; 烦躁; 雾气

ridge  山脊; 山脉

perish  死亡; 湮灭

​		It still pays to treat the world's highest peak with the utmost respect.
