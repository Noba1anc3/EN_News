​		**Unilever** New Zealand said it would begin a one-year experiment to allow all 81 of its employees to earn their full salaries while working one day fewer per week, a move the company said might actually boost productivity and improve employees' work-life balance.

​		Essentially, Unilever is testing what the British historian and writer C.

​		The move to a four-day workweek has been kicked around for decades, well before Richard Nixon, as vice president in 1956, predicted it would come to pass in the "not too distant future."

​		Still, it has remained **elusive**.

​		Societal changes, like the push to work remotely, "might lead to a reformulation of what success actually requires, " Gaudiano said.

​		Andrew Yang, who ran for president in this year's Democratic primary, is a longtime advocate of shorter workweeks. Before his campaign, as chief executive of an educational company, he frequently let employees go home early on Friday.

​		"This is a way to compete smart, " he said."If there is an enlightened company that does this, they are going to have their pick of the best people in the industry and those people are going to be extraordinarily loyal."
