## The pressure to be perfect turns deadly for celebrities in Japan

​		From the outside, Yuko Takeuchi seemed to have a golden life. She had won Japan's top acting award three times and had recently given birth to her second child.

​		Takeuchi, 40, died late last month, apparently in a suicide. No one can fully know what private **torment** might have **lurked** beneath the surface, but in a Japanese society that values "gaman" — endurance or self-denial — many feel pressure to hide their personal struggles. The burden is compounded for celebrities whose professional success depends on projecting a flawless ideal.

torment  精神折磨

lurk  潜伏

​		Takeuchi is the latest in a succession of Japanese film and television stars who have taken their own lives this year.

​		The reasons for any individual suicide are complex. And many of the strains felt by the Japanese are universal: They, like many others, feel the ruthless demands of social media, where people feel they must cultivate a narrative of eternal success and happiness.

​		Even away from social media, the Japanese tend to project a positive public front.

​		For celebrities, the normal societal pressures can be magnified by the expectations of millions of fans. And unlike in the United States, where celebrities now talk more openly about seeking out psychological help, such behavior is largely **taboo** in Japan, which has been slower to develop mental health services, despite some improvement.

taboo  禁忌; 戒律

​		"If you are a person in the spotlight and the media finds out that you are receiving mental health support, that would play badly for you and your career, " said Tamaki Tsuda, a television producer."If you go out once for mental illness, that's the image that will be tacked on to your brand forever."
