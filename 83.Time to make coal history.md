## Time to make coal history

​		Around the world the mood is shifting. President Xi Jinping has adopted a target to cut China's net carbon emissions to zero by 2060. Under Joe Biden, America will rejoin the Paris agreement, which it adopted five years ago.

​		Remarkably, in a realm where words are cheap, there has been action, too. In America and Europe the consumption of coal, the largest source of greenhouse gases, has fallen by 34% since 2009.

​		Yet coal still accounts for around 27% of the raw energy used to power everything from cars to electric grids. If global emissions are to fall far enough, fast enough, the task now is to double down on the West's success and repeat it in Asia. It will not be easy.

​		In the past decade, as Europe has turned against coal, consumption in Asia has grown by a quarter. The continent now accounts for 77% of all coal use.

​		If the aim is to limit global temperature rises to 2°C above pre-industrial levels, it is no good waiting for Asia's appetite for coal to fade. New plants are still being built. Many completed ones are not yet fully utilized and still have decades of life in them.

​		Hence Asia needs new policies to kick its coal habit, and soon. The goal should be to stop new coal-fired power plants being built and to retire existing ones. Some countries have taken a first step. The Philippines has declared a **moratorium** on new plants; Japan and **Bangladesh** are slowing construction, too. China's new five-year-plan, which will be published next year, may limit coal use. It should set its cap at current levels, so that the decline can start immediately.
