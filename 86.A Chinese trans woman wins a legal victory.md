## A Chinese trans woman wins a legal victory

​		Gao Moumou had a good job as a `product director` in Beijing for Dangdang, an ecommerce firm, which allowed her to save enough money for her `gender-reassignment surgery`. Her office gave her time off to recover, but on September 6th, 2018, less than three months after her surgery, Dangdang fired Ms Gao, citing her "`continuous absenteeism`".

absenteeism  旷工

​		But Ms Gao thinks the real reason was `transphobia`.

​		In January this year, a court in Beijing ordered Dangdang to `reinstate Ms Gao's contract` and pay her **overdue** wages. `The news circulated online` in July, and `generated 380m views` on Weibo. Ms Gao is the first transgender person to win a job-discrimination case in China.

reinstate  使恢复原职

overdue  未付的; 过期的

​		Ms Gao had a "smoking-gun" proof of discrimination, says Darius Longarino of Yale Law School.　Dangdang referred to her as "Mr" in a letter to her about her legal case and called her "`mentally ill`".The company said that other colleagues were uncomfortable working with her. But because she had legally changed her gender to female, Dangdang `was obliged to` treat her the same as other female colleagues, the court said.

oblige  强迫; 义务

​		The court also called for "tolerance" and said society must "respect and protect the personality, dignity and legitimate rights of transgender people".An online poll of 330, 000 people found that 81% viewed the court's decision positively.

​		It was good for transgender people in China, says Alex, a lgbt worker."No matter if it's positive or negative, it helps us to be seen."
