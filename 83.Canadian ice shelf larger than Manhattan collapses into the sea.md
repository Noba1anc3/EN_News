## Canadian ice shelf larger than Manhattan collapses into the sea

​		The size of Canada's last fully **intact** ice shelf was reduced by 43% over July 30 and 31 when the Milne Ice Shelf on Ellesmere Island in the northern territory of Nunavut collapsed into the ocean.

​		This large sheet of ice then drifted into the Arctic Sea, further breaking into two large chunks.
The piece that broke off was around 80 square kilometers — larger than the 60-square-kilometer Manhattan.

​		"Above-normal air temperatures, offshore winds and open water in front of the ice shelf are all part of the recipe for ice shelf break up, " according to the Canadian Ice Service.

​		The last known epishelf lake in the Arctic could be gone because of the ice shelf break. An epishelf lake is a body of freshwater trapped by an ice shelf that floats on top of ocean water.

​		When the Milne Ice Shelf collapsed, it potentially sent once-contained freshwater into the salty waters of the Arctic Ocean.

​		Ice shelves like these can help limit global sea level rise by acting like a dam, slowing the flow of melting ice and water into the oceans. These large calving events can also create hazards for the shipping industry by creating essentially large icebergs floating across the northern oceans.

​		This is not the first time this year that the Canadian Arctic has lost significant ice features.

​		Earlier this summer two of Canada's St. Patrick Bay ice caps completely disappeared. The two ice caps were located on the same Ellesmere Island as the Milne Ice Shelf in Nunavut.
