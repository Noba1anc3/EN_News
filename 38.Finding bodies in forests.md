## Finding bodies in forests

​		To study a body forensically, you first have to find it. For a **corpse** dumped in a city this is hard enough. If the burial site is a forest it can be **nigh** impossible.

corpse  尸体

nigh  几乎; 差不多

​		Neal Stewart, co-director of the Tennessee Plant Research Center, reckons that a bit of **botanical** thinking brought to bear on the matter may turn trees from being cover for the disposal of bodies to signposts showing just where they are hidden.

botanical  植物学的

​		To pursue this idea, he has organized a group of researchers, one of whom is Dawnie Steadman, the head of the Body Farm, which is known officially as the University of Tennessee **Anthropological** Research Facility. This group has come up with three ways in which **vegetation** might flag up **illicit** burials.

anthropological  人类学的

vegetation  植物; 植被

illicit  非法的

​		The most obvious is **fertilization**. Calculations suggest that a **decaying** adult human body releases about 2.6kg of nitrogenous compounds. That is 50 times the average annual recommended level of nitrogenous fertilizer for trees and **shrubs**. Such an overdose would cause a **perceptible** greening of plants.

fertilization  施肥; 受精

decay  腐烂；衰退

shrub  灌木

perceptible  可感觉的; 可感知的

​		A more subtle change in the **foliage** near a buried body would be brought about by any cadmium present within its flesh and bones. Cadmium is easily taken in by plants and affects the color of the leaves.

foliage  叶; 枝叶

​		A third change is induced by the artificial **polymers** found in clothing and shoes. These can be taken up by plants, too — sometimes altering those leaves' color.

polymer  聚合物

​		Crucially, all these effects would be visible from above. **Drones** fitted with spectroscopes that seek abnormal colors in foliage are already used by farmers to check crops for disease and drought. Dr Stewart, Dr Steadman and their colleagues are now investigating whether a similar approach can be used to scan woodlands for telltales of buried bodies.
