## Emirates Mars Mission launch

​		Three missions are launching toward the red planet, taking advantage of the way Earth and its neighbor get closer every 26 months or so, allowing a relatively short trip between the two worlds. If they launch successfully, the spacecrafts will arrive at Mars early next year.

​		The first of the three missions, built by the United Arab Emirates, lifted off Monday morning from a launch site in Japan. The spacecraft separated from the rocket about an hour later and began a journey to Mars that will last until February. The trip to the red planet begins a bold entry into interplanetary exploration by a small country that has previously only sent a few small satellites to orbit.

​		The Emirates Mars Mission, also known as Hope, is an orbiter that will study Mars from above the planet. Over its two-year mission, it will investigate how dust storms and other weather phenomena near the **Martian** surface speed or slow the loss of the planet’s atmosphere into space.

​		Two other missions are headed to Mars in the weeks to come. The next expected launch will be China’s Tianwen-1, which could occur between later this week through early August. The Chinese mission includes an orbiter, a lander and a rover that will study the Martian soil’s water and ice content, among other research targets.

​		On July 30, NASA is scheduled to launch **Perseverance**, a robotic rover that will be the fifth wheeled U.S. vehicle to explore Mars. It will land in a crater called Jezero, seeking to find signs of ancient, **extinct** life that might have once thrived when the crater was a lake.
