## How to be more efficient: stop 'precrastinating'

​		Whether or not we care to admit it, we're all familiar with **procrastination**: waiting until the last minute to catch up with pressing tasks. The **antidote** — while easier said than done — is simply to start on your assignments sooner. But in your quest to beat procrastination, is it possible to go too far?

antidote  解药; 矫正方法

​		David Rosenbaum, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside, certainly thinks so. His research focuses on the **perils** of "precrastination", the tendency to rush too quickly into tasks.
As opposed to a procrastinator, who might leave an inbox full of emails untouched until the next day, a precrastinator would read and respond to each of them first thing in the morning. This can mean depleting the precious energy they might need for a more urgent task later on.

peril  危险; 祸害

​		So why do people precrastinate? Rosenbaum says that for most, it's tough to resist reaching for low-hanging fruit. When you complete simple short-term tasks, you have one fewer thing to think about — "I can wrap this up in five minutes. Why not take care of it now?"

​		The real downside of precrastination comes when, in your rush to finish, you encounter the naturally higher chance of doing your work incompletely or inaccurately. In the case of emails, sometimes waiting to respond can show respect for careful thought over expediency.

​		Of course, precrastination is not without its benefits, but it's critical to do so only when it makes sense. Chronic precrastinators must also realize that it's OK to set **trivial** things aside, because they will not require huge mental energy later in the day, Rosenbaum says.
