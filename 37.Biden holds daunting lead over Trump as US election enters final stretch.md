## Biden holds daunting lead over Trump as US election enters final stretch

​		One hundred days before the `presidential election`, Joe Biden has built a **commanding** and enduring lead over Donald Trump, whose path to victory has narrowed **considerably** in the months since the coronavirus pandemic began.

​		The president's fortunes appear increasingly tied to the **trajectory** of a public health crisis he has failed to contain, with the death toll past 145, 000 and the economy in **turmoil**.

turmoil  骚动;  混乱

​		A Washington Post-ABC News poll this month showed Biden far ahead of Trump, 55% to 40% among registered voters. That contrasted with March, when Biden and Trump were locked in a near tie as the virus was just beginning to spread.

​		Especially troubling for the president are a new spate of polls that suggest he is losing his edge on the economy, formerly Biden's greatest vulnerability.

​		Biden's campaign is now eyeing an expanded electoral map that could also deliver control of the Senate, challenging Trump in traditionally Republican states like Arizona, where the former vice-president has consistently led in statewide polls, as well as in conservative **strongholds** like Texas, where a new Quinnipiac poll found the candidates **neck-and-neck**.

​		There are risks for Biden, too, particularly as the race intensifies. Trump supporters are far more enthusiastic and committed to voting than are supporters of Biden. And Democrats worry particularly about support from black, Hispanic and young voters, who are crucial to building a winning coalition.

​		"This race is far from over, " said Sam Nunberg, a former adviser to Trump."The president has proved that he can come back from behind before."
