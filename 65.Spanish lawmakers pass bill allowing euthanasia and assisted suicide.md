## Spanish lawmakers pass bill allowing euthanasia and assisted suicide

​		Spanish lawmakers on Thursday voted in favor of a law **decriminalizing** **euthanasia** and physician-assisted suicide, making it likely that Spain will join a handful of other countries where terminally ill patients can legally obtain help to end their lives.

​		Aid in dying remains hotly debated in several countries and has been at the heart of several major court cases. Earlier this year, a German court overturned a ban on assisted suicide.

​		On Thursday in Madrid, a small group of demonstrators gathered outside the Parliament to oppose the new law to the beat of funeral drums, some waving skull-and-crossbone signs.

​		But during the parliamentary debate, María Luisa Carcedo, a former health minister, argued that the law allowed Spain to take "a step forward in civil rights." Far from being "an imposition by the state, " she added, the law meant that "it is the patient who decides."

​		Conservative lawmakers voted against the law. Lourdes Méndez, a lawmaker for the far-right Vox party, said that the law amounted to "signing death sentences for the weakest."

​		Until now, a person suffering from a **terminal** illness in Spain could refuse treatment, but the new law will also allow such a patient to receive assistance to endure a painless death, as long as that help is sought "freely and unequivocally."

​		Before seeking assistance, the law says, patients must have been granted full information about their conditions. The law also specifies that the request to die must be made in writing and must then be repeated 15 days later.
