## COMAC C919: China takes on Airbus and Boeing

​		As aviation **tentatively** reboots, Boeing and its European rival Airbus are **duking** it out for the **lion's share** of the recovering market with their B737 and A320 airplanes respectively — a dynamic that's **contingent** upon Boeing resolving its 737 MAX **woes**.

​		Meanwhile, China has developed — and is now at the stage of flight testing — a homegrown contender, the COMAC C919.

​		"The COMAC C919 is designed to be an 'international airliner with Chinese characteristics, '" says Cristiano Ceccato, director of Zaha Hadid Architects."This means an ability to match the quality and safety established by Boeing and Airbus, but also by incorporating the specific needs of the Chinese market: High-density, high-frequency missions with fast turnaround times from airfields with broadly varying levels of development."

​		But what sets the COMAC plane apart from its Western rivals in terms of the in-flight experience?
Safran Cabin says it will supply the **lavatories**, galleys, and **cockpit** doors for the C919. The company told CNN that "the lavatories are larger than what is now commonly seen on competing aircraft."

​		Larger restrooms aren't the only difference. The back of the aircraft will feature a full-sized **galley** with ample space for the flight crew to work.

​		The aircraft's engines are also claimed to be more efficient. The CFM LEAP-1C engine, which was selected by COMAC for the C919, offers "a 15% reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions versus current engines, " says Safran.

​		COMAC's C919 still has some way to go, especially in uncertain times. But if successful, longer term, a third option for aviation's short- and medium-haul market could significantly redistribute the balance of power in civil aviation.
