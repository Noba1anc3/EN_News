## Millions of Americans still get their drinking water from lead pipes

​		Over a century has passed since the dangers of consuming **lead** became widely known. Yet residents of Chicago — and many other cities — still mostly **swig** from taps fed by lead pipes.

​		About 400, 000 lead service lines connect to the mains in the Windy City, linking about four in five of all houses there. One study of nearly 3, 000 homes, two years ago, found two-thirds had **elevated** levels of lead in their water.

​		The city's water **woes** can be blamed in part on the historic **clout** of industrial lobbyists and a union of **plumbers**. In the last century, they **nudged** Chicago's political bosses to set rules making lead pipes **compulsory**. That lasted until a federal ban on new lead pipes in 1986.

​		Mayors are more alert to the problem these days, especially since the water crisis in 2014 in Flint, Michigan. Erik Olson of the Natural Resources Defense Council says thousands of water systems across the country still face "serious problems".

​		Cities want to make changes, but swapping out 10m service lines could cost $50bn.Twice this summer the House of Representatives passed bills to start paying for it. Proposed infrastructure bills also include sums for removing lead pipes. But in the Senate such plans have, so far, led nowhere.

​		Joe Biden's administration could nudge things on. The EPA may set higher standards again. A bill co-sponsored by a Republican congressman, Chris Smith, would require all lead pipes to be replaced within a decade. His timetable may look too ambitious, but waiting for 500 more years to fix the problem isn't much of a plan, either.
