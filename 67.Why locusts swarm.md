## Why locusts swarm

​		Covid-19 is not the only plague that 2020 has brought. In parts of Asia and east Africa, **swarms** of **locusts** have **stripped** fields.

​		Locusts are usually inoffensive, **solitary** creatures that do not **stray** far from the place that they were born. But under the right circumstances — namely heavy rain, and a subsequent boom in plant growth — they can become "**gregarious**".When that happens the insects gather in **ravenous** swarms which can fly more than 100km in a day.

stray  迷路; 偏离

gregarious  交际的; 合群的; 群居的

ravenous  严重的; 十分的

​		In a paper published in Nature, Xiaojiao Guo and a group of other researchers shed light on part of the biochemical machinery that drives that transformation. Dr Guo and her colleagues collected 35 chemicals collected from the bodies and **faeces** of the migratory locust. When tested, gregarious locusts were strongly attracted to just one, a chemical called 4-vinylanisole (4VA).

faeces  粪便

​		Scientists already know that swarming is a response to overcrowding, and Dr Guo and her colleagues found that 4VA production rose with population density. Further investigation pinpointed the odour receptor on the insect's **antennae** that is sensitive to the compound.

antennae  触角

​		Humans have tried everything from insecticides to flame-throwers to deal with locust swarms, with mixed results. Pheromones offer new angles of attack. Synthetic versions of 4VA might be used to **bait** traps. If a chemical could be developed that blocks the receptor, the insects might be made deaf to its call.

bait  鱼饵

​		The first task will be to determine how widely applicable the results are. If 4VA turns out to be a language that all locusts understand, then it may help humans persuade them to abandon their gregarious ways, and return to a life of peaceable **solitude**.
