## In Lagos, a homegrown ballet academy leaps into the spotlight

​		In June, a minute-long video featuring a young ballet student dancing in the rain began circulating on the internet. As the rain falls, forming **puddles** between the **uneven** **slabs** of concrete on which he dances, Anthony Mmesoma Madu, 11, turns **pirouette** after pirouette.

puddle  水坑

uneven  不平坦的; 不规则的

slab  厚板; 厚片

pirouette  单脚尖旋转

​		The wide reach of the video — it has been seen more than 20 million times on social media platforms — has turned a spotlight on the unlikely story of a ballet school in a poor suburb of Lagos, Nigeria: the Leap of Dance Academy.

​		Founded in 2017, the academy has transformed the lives of its students, affording them a place to dance and to dream.

​		For now, the Leap of Dance Academy is housed at the home of its founder, Daniel Owoseni Ajala, in Ajangbadi, Ojo, on the western outskirts of Lagos. Every day after school, Ajala's 12 students walk to his apartment, where he pushes aside his furniture and spreads a thin vinyl sheet over the cement floor for class, throwing open the doors and windows to let in the light.

​		Against swaths of candy-colored **chiffon** — intended to make the **humble** setting a little more festive — students move through their lessons in small groups, leaning against a short, stationary ballet barre and craning their necks to watch Ajala, or an overseas instructor on Zoom, give corrections.

chiffon  雪纺

humble  谦逊的; 卑微的

festive  节日的; 喜庆的

​		"We have heard from so many people who are inspired by the students and by dance, " Ajala said."They felt our joy and came alive. They reminded us that art is here to stay."
