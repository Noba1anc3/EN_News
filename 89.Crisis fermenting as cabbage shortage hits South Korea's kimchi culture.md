## Crisis fermenting as cabbage shortage hits South Korea's kimchi culture

​		South Koreans are facing a shortage of a beloved dietary **staple** after a summer of extreme weather destroyed crops of cabbages — the main ingredient of kimchi.

ferment  发酵

staple  主要的; 基本的

​		Fields of Chinese cabbages were wiped out in August and September, when the Korean peninsula was struck by typhoons, floods and landslides, sparking a sudden spike in the vegetable's price.

​		The damage has left households struggling to find affordable cabbages to turn into the spicy pickle. The shortage, which has seen prices rise by up to 60%, comes just before the start of the traditional kimchi-making season.

​		The **communal** act of making kimchi, known as kimjang, was added to Unesco's **intangible** cultural heritage list in 2013. The UN body said the tradition "reaffirms Korean identity and is an excellent opportunity for strengthening family cooperation".

communal  共享的

intangible  无形的; 非物质的

​		But this year the autumnal **rite** got off to a slow start after crops were ruined.

rite  仪式; 典礼

​		The cabbage shortfall is also affecting commercial producers, according to Bloomberg, with the country's biggest kimchi maker, Daesang, saying it has been forced to suspend online sales. Another said it was looking for alternative supplies — possibly from China, a major cabbage exporter.

​		Kimchi is an **indispensable** part of the Korean diet, with South Koreans eating more than 2m tonnes every year.

indispensable  不可或缺的

​		Though it often appears in stews and soups, no meal is considered complete without a side dish of the pungent, fermented cabbage, along with kimchi variations made from daikon radish, cucumber, perilla leaf or other `seasonal vegetables`.
