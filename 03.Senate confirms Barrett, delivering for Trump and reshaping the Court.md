## Senate confirms Barrett, delivering for Trump and reshaping the Court

​		Judge Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative appeals court judge, was confirmed on Monday to the Supreme Court, capping a lightning-fast Senate approval that handed President Donald Trump a victory before the election and promised to tip the court to the right for years to come.

​		Inside a Capitol mostly emptied by the **resurgent** coronavirus pandemic, Republicans overcame **unanimous** Democratic opposition to make Barrett the 115th justice of the Supreme Court and the fifth woman.

unanimous  一致的

​		It was the first time in 151 years that a justice was confirmed without the support of a single member of the minority party, a sign of how bitter Washington's war over judicial nominations has become.

​		The vote concluded a brazen drive by Republicans to fill the vacancy created by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg just six weeks before the election. They **shredded** their own past pronouncements and bypassed rules in the process, even as they stared down the potential loss of the White House and the Senate.

​		Barrett pledged during her confirmation hearings to be an independent mind. But she is widely viewed by both parties as a judge who would rule consistently in favor of conservative positions.

​		Barrett, 48, was Trump's third nominee to the Supreme Court, but arrayed beneath her were 162 new district court judges and 53 appeals court judges who have been installed by Republicans over the past four years, roughly a third of the entire federal appellate bench. Together, they could hold broad sway over American law and policy long after Trump leaves office.
