## Ant Group and fintech come of age

​		In 1300 or so Marco Polo introduced Europeans to a monetary marvel witnessed in China. The emperor, he wrote, "causes the bark of trees, made into something like paper, to pass for money all over his country".

​		Eventually the West also adopted paper money, some six centuries after China invented it. More recent foreign travelers to China have come back agog at the next big step for money: the total disappearance of paper, replaced by pixels on phone screens.

​		China's pre-**eminence** in digital money is likely to be on display in the next few weeks with the monster listing of Ant Group, its largest fintech firm, in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Measured by cash raised, it will probably be the biggest initial public offering in history. Ant's rise **portends** a bigger transformation of how the financial system works — not just in China but around the world.

eminence  卓越; 著名

portend  预兆; 预示

​		There is much to be excited about. At its best, fintech offers big gains in efficiency. Ant makes razor-thin margins on payments and takes minutes to grant a loan. Digitization also promises to broaden the spread of finance. Reaching customers will be easier and data will make loan underwriting more accurate.

​		Yet as the fintech surge continues, governments should take a **holistic** view of financial risk that includes banks and fintech firms. Governments should also lower barriers to entry so as to boost competition. Last, the rise of fintech must be tied to a renewed effort to protect people's privacy from giant companies and the state.

holistic  整体的; 全面的

​		So long as fintech can be made safer, open and respectful of individual rights, then a monetary innovation led by China will once again change the world for the better.
