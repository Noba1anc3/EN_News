## Can China look past **counterfeits** and superstition in its burgeoning second-hand fashion market

​		China may produce and consume more apparel than anywhere else in the world, but when it comes to buying pre-owned clothes, the country lags behind fashion's other major players. The Chinese resale market is somewhat **stunted** by fears over counterfeiting, the ongoing social status attached to new goods and even superstitions around wearing other people's clothes.

counterfeits  伪造; 赝品

superstition  迷信

burgeon  激增; 迅速发展

apparel  衣服

stunted  发育不足的

​		Rental and pre-owned retail services offer ways for shoppers to keep their wardrobes varied. In the globe's most **populous** country, however, appetite for second-hand clothing remains **lackluster**. This could be a matter of positioning, according to fashion influencer Xie Xinyan. Low-end **thrift** stores may be rare in China, but the 24-year-old has witnessed a significant jump in the number of higher-end outlets marketing themselves as "**vintage**."

populous  人口众多的

lackluster  无光泽

thrift  节俭; 节约

vintage  古色古香的; (过去某个时期) 典型的; 优质的

​		Just as resale platforms in the West are powered by Generation-Z and millennial consumers, China's upwardly mobile "balinghou" and "jiulinghou" (the post-80s and -90s generations) appear to be driving the luxury resale market. The clothing rental sector is also targeting these younger consumers, said Liu Mengyuan, founder and CEO of Beijing-based subscription service YCloset.

​		But it remains a comparatively **embryonic** market. While a 2019 report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) predicted that preowned goods will account for 9% of all luxury sales globally by 2021, they make up just 2% of the country's luxury goods transactions in China. China's preowned luxury market may be "emerging steadily, " the BCG report noted, but it is "not yet well structured and no large players have appeared."
