## Chocolate industry slammed for failure to crack down on child labor

​		Nearly 20 years after the world's major chocolate manufacturers pledged to **abolish** employment abuses, **hazardous** child labor remains **rife** in their `supply chains`, a new study finds.

​		Research from the University of Chicago finds that more than two-fifths (43%) of all children aged between five and 17 in cocoa-growing regions of Ghana and Ivory Coast — the world's largest cocoa producers — are engaged in hazardous work.

​		The findings raise difficult questions for industry in particular. Back in 2001, big brands such as Nestlé, Mars and Hershey signed a cross-sector **accord** aimed at eliminating **egregious** child labor. Despite missing deadlines to `deliver on` their pledge in 2005, 2008 and 2010, they continue to insist that ending the illegal practice remains their `top concern`.

​		In response to the **scathing** report, US chocolate giant Mars reiterated that child labor has no place in cocoa production and said it had committed $1bn to help "fix a broken supply chain".Campaign groups **dismiss** such comments as a **duplicitous** smokescreen. Indeed, a lawsuit stating that international chocolate manufacturers knowingly profit from abuses against children is currently being heard in the US supreme court.

​		Charity Ryerson, founder of US campaign group Corporate Accountability Lab, echoes a widespread feeling that the chocolate industry is guilty of "mind-boggling **hypocrisy**".If it wished to, it could end child labor tomorrow, she said.

hypocrisy  伪善

​		Louisa Cox, impact director at the Fairtrade Foundation, **concedes** that more help is needed to tackle practical problems if child labor is finally to become a thing of the past. Her list includes the **provision** of long-term finance, training and technical services, as well as helping farmers diversify beyond cocoa.
