## Lee Kun-hee, who made Suth Korea's Samsung a global powerhouse, dies at 78

​		Lee Kun-hee, who built Samsung Electronics into a global powerhouse, died on Sunday after spending more than six years in hospital following a `heart attack`, the company said.

​		Lee grew the Samsung Group into South Korea's biggest conglomerate and became the country's richest person. Samsung Group affiliates' 326.7 trillion won ($289.6 billion) in 2019 revenue was worth about 17% of South Korea's GDP, according to Fair Trade Commission data.

​		Lee's aggressive bets on new businesses, especially semiconductors, helped grow the conglomerate his father Lee Byung-chull built from a noodle trading business into a global powerhouse with assets worth $375 billion, including dozens of affiliates stretching from electronics and insurance to shipbuilding and construction.

​		"His legacy will be **everlasting**, " Samsung said in a statement.

everlasting  永久的; 永恒的

​		Lee is the latest second-generation leader of a South Korean family-controlled conglomerate, or chaebol, to die, leaving potentially **thorny** succession issues for the third generation.

thorny  棘手的; 麻烦的

​		The death of Lee, with a net worth of $20.9 billion according to Forbes, is set to prompt investor interest in a potential restructuring of the group involving his stakes in key Samsung companies such as Samsung Life Insurance and Samsung Electronics.

​		"For Lee's son, Jay Y. Lee, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, getting the most of that stake Lee Kun-hee holds is more important than ever, " said Ahn Sang-hee, a corporate governance expert at Daishin Economic Research Institute."The key here is with taxes. Coming up with enough taxes related to inheritance and avoiding possible **disputes** with his sisters are major hurdles."

dispute  争论; 争端

​		The conglomerate did not specify the cause of death and declined to comment on whether Lee left a will.
