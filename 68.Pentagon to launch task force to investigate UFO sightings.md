## Pentagon to launch task force to investigate UFO sightings

​		Members of Congress and Pentagon officials have long expressed concerns about the appearance of the unidentified aircraft that have flown over US military bases, posing a risk to military jets. There is no consensus on their origin with some believing they may be drones potentially operated by earthly adversaries seeking to gather intelligence rather than **extraterrestrials**.

​		Three short videos released by the Pentagon appear to show unidentified flying objects rapidly moving while recorded by infrared cameras. Two of the videos contain service members reacting in awe at how quickly the objects are moving. One voice speculates that it could be a drone.

​		In May CNN obtained "**hazard** reports" detailing encounters between US Navy aircraft and "unidentified aerial phenomena" from the Navy Safety Center."The unknown aircraft appeared to be small in size, approximately the size of a suitcase, and silver in color, " one report describing an incident from March 26, 2014, said.

​		The Pentagon had previously studied recordings of aerial encounters with unknown objects. That program was launched in 2007 and ended in 2012, according to the Pentagon, because they assessed that there were higher priorities that needed funding. The former head of the program Luis Elizondo told CNN in 2017 that he personally believes "there is very compelling evidence that we may not be alone."
