## Forbidden City at 600, How China's imperial palace survived against the odds

​		Decades of conflict

​		Conflict has also posed a regular threat to the Forbidden City. In 1644, most of the palace was destroyed at the hands of rebel leader Li Zicheng. His troops set fire to the palace compound, destroying most of its buildings.

​		Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, a series of domestic uprisings and foreign conflicts also threatened the Forbidden City, as the Qing began to lose their grip on the country. These **culminated** in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, and the most serious infringement to the **sanctity** of the Forbidden City in over 250 years.

culminate  告终; 结束

sanctity  神圣; 圣洁

​		In 1925, it fully opened as a public museum. Only six years after the Palace Museum opened, however, the threat posed by Japan's invasion of Manchuria, to the north of Beijing, meant that many of the Forbidden City's most valuable treasures had to be removed from the capital.

​		Into the modern age

​		The main threat to the palace today is not fire or conflict, but simple age, coupled with the footfall of millions of visitors who tour the site each year.

​		Though some **renovations** can be traced back to preparations for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, changes to the Palace Museum have gathered pace since President Xi's **ascendancy**, particularly as the palace's 600th birthday approached.

renovation  翻修; 革新

ascendancy  支配地位; 优势

​		The Palace Museum's new director, Wang Xudong, has observed the importance of employing new technology to increase the landmark's profile within China. A recent partnership with Tencent to digitize palace treasures and offer immersive virtual reality experiences is part of this approach, as is the museum's use of social media.
