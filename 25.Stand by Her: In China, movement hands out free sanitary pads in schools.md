## Stand by Her: In China, movement hands out free sanitary pads in schools

​		It started when a single box of free **sanitary pads** appeared in a middle school classroom in October. Then a plastic container with pads was attached to the walls of four bathrooms in a university in Shanghai.

sanitary pads  卫生巾

​		By Monday, boxes and bags of individually wrapped pads had popped up outside bathrooms in at least 338 schools and colleges across China. Each carried a version of the same instructions: "Take one, then put one back later. Stop `period shaming`."

​		The pads were part of a broader effort to increase access to a product that not all students can afford and to **strip** away the shame surrounding a natural bodily function that has long been **stigmatized**, according to organizers of a `grassroots` campaign called Stand by Her.

stigmatize  使感到羞耻; 侮蔑

​		Founded by Jiang Jinjing, a women’s rights advocate, the campaign aims to push the subject of period poverty to the forefront of the national conversation.

​		The inability to afford **menstrual** products is common in many countries, and that inaccessibility is often compounded by social mores that view menstruation as a taboo topic.

menstrual  月经的

​		A study published in July by the Maple Women’s Psychological Counseling Center in Beijing found that nearly 70% of respondents said that they tried to hide the sanitary pads they carry around, and more than 61% used **euphemisms** for their period.

euphemism  委婉语; 委婉说法

​		Jiang said in a post online: "The process of having loud and frequent discussions will remove the stigma from menstruation."She noted that "pads" and "periods, " once taboo words, were being more commonly discussed in the country.

​		"This already is a huge breakthrough and milestone, " she said.
