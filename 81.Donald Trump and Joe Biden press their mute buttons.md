## Donald Trump and Joe Biden press their mute buttons

​		Donald Trump and Joe Biden are not merely the two oldest candidates to contest a presidential election. They also may be the most **prolix**. However, in the campaign's second and last debate, both campaigns signaled that they wanted their candidates to allow the other more speaking time.

prolix  繁琐的; 啰嗦的

​		Mr Trump's campaign believed that the more Mr Biden spoke, the **likelier** he was to **ramble** and lose his train of thought. Mr Biden's camp — judging by the first debate's **aftermath**, in which Mr Biden's polling lead grew after Trump repeatedly interrupted, **hectored** and insulted him — reasoned that the more airtime Mr Trump gets, the less voters like him.

likelier  可能的

ramble  漫游; 闲逛

aftermath  后果; 创伤

hector  威逼; 威吓

​		In keeping quiet, both candidates had help from the Commission on Presidential Debates. **Wary** of repeating the chaos of the first debate, it muted the candidates' microphones when the other was giving opening statements for each of the night's six sections.

wary  小心的; 谨慎的

​		Debates rarely matter much, and last night's affair is probably no exception. Both candidates' exchanges were revealing, highlighting their difference in character and occasionally even policy. But with Mr Biden's steady and sizeable polling lead — Mr Trump's discipline may have come too late to help him.

​		The president's **untheatrical** performance also highlighted the **thinness** of his positive case. He gave viewers no hint of his **substantive** policy priorities for a second term, other than a desire "to make our country totally successful".Mr Biden, by contrast, proved fluent in the details of his health-care, climate-change and immigration policies.

theatrical  戏剧的

thinness  瘦弱; 浅薄

substantive  实质性的; 本质上的

​		Mr Biden's performance was not flawless. Republicans see an opening in his vow to wean America off oil, which may cost him votes in battleground states with large extractive industries, such as Texas, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
