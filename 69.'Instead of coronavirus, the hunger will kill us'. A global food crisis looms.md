## 'Instead of coronavirus, the hunger will kill us'. A global food crisis looms

​		In the largest **slum** in Kenya's capital, people desperate to eat **set off** a **stampede** during a recent giveaway of flour and cooking oil, leaving **scores** injured and two people dead. In India, thousands of workers are lining up twice a day for bread and fried vegetables to keep hunger **at bay**.

​		The coronavirus pandemic has brought hunger to millions of people around the world. An estimated 265 million people could be pushed to the brink of starvation by year's end."We've never seen anything like this before, " said Arif Husain, chief economist at the World Food Program, a U.N. agency."It wasn't a pretty picture to begin with, but this makes it truly **unprecedented** and **uncharted** territory."

uncharted  人迹罕至的

​		The world has experienced severe hunger crises before, but those were regional and caused by one factor or another — extreme weather, economic downturns, wars or political instability. This hunger crisis, experts say, is global and caused by a multitude of factors linked to the coronavirus pandemic and the **ensuing** interruption of the economic order.

ensuing  随之产生的; 接踵而来的

​		There is no shortage of food globally, or mass starvation from the pandemic — yet. But **logistical** problems in planting, harvesting and transporting food will leave poor countries exposed in the coming months, especially those reliant on imports, said Johan Swinnen, director general of the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington.

logistical  后勤的; 物流的

​		To **assuage** the impact of this crisis, some governments are fixing prices on food items, delivering free food and putting in place plans to send money transfers to the poorest households. Yet communities across the world are also taking matters into their own hands. Some are raising money through crowdfunding platforms, while others have begun programs to buy meals for **needy** families.
