​		Last Wednesday the US ordered the Chinese consulate in Houston to close, alleging that it had become a hub for spying and property theft. Tensions have been escalating between the two countries over a number of issues.

​		What happened in Chengdu?

​		Chinese state media showed pictures of lorries leaving the US consulate, and workers removing diplomatic insignia from the building.

​		Dozens of Chinese police were deployed outside the building, urging **onlookers** to move on. However, **boos** were heard when a bus with tinted windows left the building on Sunday, the AFP news agency reports.

​		What happened in Houston last week?

​		After a 72-hour deadline for Chinese diplomats to leave the Houston consulate expired on Friday, reporters saw men who appeared to be US officials force open a door to enter the premises.

​		US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo explained the Houston closure, saying Washington had acted because Beijing was "stealing" intellectual property. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin responded that the US move was based on "a hodgepodge of anti-Chinese lies".

​		Why is there tension between China and the US?

​		There are a number of things at play. President Trump has alleged, without evidence, that coronavirus originated from a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan. The US and China have also been locked in a tariff war since 2018.
