pardon  赦免；原谅

​		The pardons extend Trump's streak of **wielding** his **clemency** powers for criminals who are loyalists, well-connected to his family. While all presidents issue controversial pardons at the end of their terms, Trump appears to be moving at a faster pace than his predecessors, demonstrating little **inhibition** at rewarding his friends and allies.

clemency  仁慈；宽恕

inhibition  拘束；抑制

​		The pardons of Manafort and Stone reward two of the most high-profile and widely condemned former advisers of the President, both of whom were indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller, went to trial and were convicted of multiple crimes.

​		Charles Kushner, meanwhile, had been prosecuted in the early 2000s.He eventually **pleaded guilty** to 16 counts of tax evasion, one count of **retaliating** against a federal witness and another count of lying to the Federal Election Commission.

plead guilty  认罪

retaliate  报复

​		Throughout his term, the President has largely ignored the established government process to review and recommend clemency requests, instead relying on the word of friends, donors and Fox News hosts.

​		Of the 20 clemencies Trump issued Tuesday night, only three had existing petitions with the Justice Department's Office of Pardon Attorney, the department said.

​		The department previously told CNN in November that it played a role in only eight of the 27 pardons and **commutations** Trump had granted at the time.
