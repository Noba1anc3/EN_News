## Airbnb was like a family, until the layoffs started

​		On May 5, Brian Chesky, Airbnb's chief executive, cried into his video camera.

​		Looking into his webcam, he read from a script that he had written to tell his employees that the coronavirus had crushed the travel industry, including their home rental `startup`. Divisions would have to be cut and workers laid off.

​		Within a few hours, 1, 900 employees — a quarter of Airbnb's workforce — were told they were out.

​		In many ways, Airbnb was the ideal example of a commitment culture company. Along the way to a $31 billion valuation, Airbnb built a reputation for the **earnest** idealism. Chesky spoke frequently of **trustworthiness**, authenticity and a desire to build a business that valued principles and people over the `short-termism` of Wall Street.

earnest  非常认真的; 诚实的; 真诚的

trustworthiness  可信赖性

​		So in March, when the coronavirus **hurtled** in, the **rupturing** of the "Airfam" was painful. Airbnb, which had been `on track` to go public this year, suddenly faced an **avalanche** of travel cancellations. Revenue evaporated. Weeks later, Chesky announced the **layoffs** and `scaled back` the company's ambitions.

rupture  断裂，破裂

layoff  解雇，裁员

​		From the outside, Airbnb's commitment culture appeared intact. But more than a dozen current and former Airbnb employees said in interviews that they had experienced a sudden **disillusionment** when the carefully crafted corporate idealism cracked.

disillusionment  幻想破灭; 醒悟

​		Kaspian Clark, 38, who worked in customer support in Portland, Oregon, for around two years, said,"There are a lot of people who feel very betrayed by this. I deeply hope that Airbnb is able to remain the thing that I believed in."
