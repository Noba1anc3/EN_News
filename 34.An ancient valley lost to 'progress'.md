## An ancient valley lost to 'progress'

​		Graced with **mosques** and **shrines**, Hasankeyf lay nestled beneath great sandstone cliffs on the banks of the **Tigris** River. The golden cliffs, honeycombed with caves, are thought to have been used in Neolithic times. An ancient **fortress** marked what was once the edge of the Roman Empire.

​		Now it is all lost forever, **submerged** beneath the rising waters of the Ilisu Dam, the latest of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's megaprojects, which flooded 100 miles of the upper Tigris River and its **tributaries**, including the once-**stunning** valley.

stunning  极有魅力的; 绝妙的

​		Government officials have emphasized that hydropower offered their greenest option when they decided to push ahead with the dam a dozen years ago, allowing Turkey to reduce its dependence on imported coal and gas.

​		But environmentalists and **archaeologists**, in Turkey and abroad, are angry and frustrated, at the loss of the valley and its treasures.

​		Fatime Salkan had refused to leave the low-pitched stone house that belonged to her parents. She watched from her **terrace** in December when Dutch engineers lifted the last of the medieval monuments, the 1, 700-ton El-Rizk mosque, onto wheels.

terrace  阳台

​		They deposited it on a man-made hill beside the new town, where the government has assembled various **salvaged** monuments. They look out of place on the bare hillside, which will be made into a new archaeological park.

salvage  打捞，营救

​		But for the purists, the new Hasankeyf is artificial and charmless."The real history is down there, and we are **drowning** it, " said Zulku Emer, 41, a master craftsman who was laying a cobbled street beside the new park.

drown  (使)淹死，溺死
