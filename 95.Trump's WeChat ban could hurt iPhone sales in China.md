## Trump's WeChat ban could hurt iPhone sales in China

​		President Donald Trump's order banning U.S. companies from doing business with Chinese messaging app WeChat could damage iPhone sales in one of Apple Inc.'s most important markets.

​		The order would block all transactions involving WeChat, which would prohibit Apple from distributing WeChat to mobile devices through its App Store. WeChat is central to digital life in China. It's the go-to app for a billion people for shopping, payments, email, web browsing and all forms of business and personal communications.

​		Without access to WeChat, consumers would likely balk at buying an iPhone in China and other parts of Asia. An online forum popular with stock investors asked users if they would give up their iPhones or WeChat if Apple eliminated the app from its store: They voted to **ditch** their phones by a margin of 20 to one.

ditch  摆脱; 放弃

​		China accounts for about 20% of Apple's iPhone sales, so pulling WeChat off the App Store "would be a serious **hindrance**, " said Anand Srinivasan, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.

hindrance  妨碍; 阻挠

​		Trump's order could also prompt China to **retaliate**, damaging Apple even further. Much of the Cupertino, California-based company's manufacturing is done in China, and if the country targets Apple's exports that would impact its business globally, Srinivasan said.

​		If the ban does go ahead and Apple doesn't have a **workaround**, Chinese consumers who have the money to buy an iPhone will likely turn to the country's home-grown, high-end smartphone maker: Huawei. In that way, the order could end up benefiting a company that Trump has sought to squeeze out for years.
