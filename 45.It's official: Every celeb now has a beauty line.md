## It's official: Every celeb now has a beauty line

​		When Selena Gomez introduced her makeup brand, Rare Beauty, this year, she took on a role often **delegated** to a makeup artist: For Sephora, the brand's exclusive retailer, she filmed all the education and training videos herself, iPhone in selfie mode, duct-taped to her bathroom mirror in Los Angeles.

delegate  授(权); 把(工作、权力等)委托(给下级)

​		Gomez is one of the latest in a wave of celebrities no longer content to be a spokeswoman. They join an old guard of celebrity beauty **moguls** like Rihanna, whose Fenty Beauty generated an estimated $570 million in revenue in its first 15 months.

mogul  大亨; 有权势的人

​		Why is a makeup line now a necessary accessory of fame?

​		Starting your own company — à la Gomez, or Lady Gaga's Haus Laboratories — is generally more **lucrative** than a licensing deal. Both can generate more cash than being a spokeswoman does.

lucrative  赚大钱的; 获利多的

​		Katie Slater, a partner at William Morris Endeavor who handles celebrity **endorsements** cited the money clients could make, along with the creative control they could exert. Instead of just turning up for shoots and **PR** days, stars can have a say in what is being said. Besides, doesn't every star these days want to be a multihyphenate?

endorsement  赞同，支持

PR  公关

​		What does a would-be makeup mogul want?

​		Makeup and skin care are what's hot for would-be moguls. They are bigger slices of the beauty industry — skin care alone accounts for anywhere from 45% to 60% of the profits — and they are now easier to get into than ever. Thanks to e-commerce, they require less capital because there's no need to hire a department store sales force to push products.

​		With so many brands, it's impossible for everyone to be successful, but don't expect the pipeline to dry up anytime soon.
