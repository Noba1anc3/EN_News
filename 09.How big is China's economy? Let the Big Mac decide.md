## How big is China's economy? Let the Big Mac decide

​		In 2019 China's workers produced over 99trn yuan-worth of goods and services. America's produced $21.4trn-worth. Since it took about 6.9 yuan to buy a dollar last year, China's GDP was worth only $14trn when converted into dollars at market rates. That was well short of America's.

​		But 6.9 yuan stretches further in China than a dollar goes in America. One example is the McDonald's Big Mac. It costs about 21.70 yuan in China and $5.71 in America, according to prices collected by The Economist. By that measure, it takes only 3.8 yuan to buy as much as a dollar. But if that is the case, then 99trn yuan can buy as much as $26trn, and China's economy is already considerably bigger than America's.
Every few years the World Bank embarks on a vastly more systematic effort to **gauge** purchasing power by comparing thousands of prices across the world. But it is fraught with difficulties. An item may be a **staple** in one place and a delicacy in another. The World Bank must decide how much weight to give each item.

​		So it might help to check the World Bank's results against a cruder yardstick — like the price of a Big Mac. 

​		Our index suggests that the bank now, if anything, underestimates the buying power of China's currency, and therefore its economic size. McDonald's was once a symbol of America's economic might. Now the Big Mac shows how its **might** is being surpassed.
