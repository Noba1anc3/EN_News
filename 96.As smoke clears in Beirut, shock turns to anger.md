## As smoke clears in Beirut, shock turns to anger

​		Since an orphaned shipment of highly explosive chemicals arrived at the port of **Beirut** in 2013, **Lebanese** officials treated it the way they have dealt with the country's lack of electricity, poisonous tap water and overflowing garbage: by **bickering** and hoping the problem might solve itself.

Lebanon  黎巴嫩

​		But the 2, 750 tons of high-density **ammonium** nitrate **combusted** Tuesday, unleashing a `shock wave` on the Lebanese capital that gutted landmark buildings, killed 135 people, wounded at least 5, 000 and rendered hundreds of thousands of residents homeless.

ammonium  铵

combust  燃烧

​		Many saw the explosion as the **culmination** of years of mismanagement and neglect by the country's politicians.

culmination  顶点; 巅峰

​		After its civil war ended in 1990, Lebanon aimed to rebuild itself as a cultural and financial hub in the Middle East. But former **warlords** became power-brokers in its weak **sectarian** democracy, which divided power — and spoils — among the nation's 18 recognized religious sects.

warlord  军阀

sectarian  教派的; 宗教的

​		The system led to chronic political **deadlock** and widespread corruption, as well as **shoddy** infrastructure and massive government debt.

shoddy  粗制滥造的; 卑鄙的

​		Public dissatisfaction boiled over late last year, when protesters took to the streets calling for the **ouster** of the political class. The protests **toppled** the prime minister, but Lebanon's troubles only grew worse. Since then, the currency has lost 80% of its value, unemployment has spiked and prices have skyrocketed.

ouster  罢免; 革职

topple  倒下; 推翻

​		Few Lebanese have any faith that the government will help them or `get to the bottom of` the explosion that **ravaged** the capital.
