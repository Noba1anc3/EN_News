## Legendary Paris bookshop Shakespeare and Company begs for help in pandemic

​		One of the world's most iconic bookshops, Shakespeare and Company, has appealed to its customers for help as it is struggling, with sales that are down almost 80% since March.

​		The celebrated Parisian bookstore told readers on Wednesday that it was facing "hard times" as the Covid-19 pandemic keeps customers away. France is expected to impose a new four-week national lockdown as coronavirus cases continue to surge; large swathes of the country, including Paris, are already under a night-time curfew.

​		First opened by Sylvia Beach in 1919, the Parisian institution was frequented by writers including F Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, TS Eliot and James Joyce in the early 20th century. George Whitman opened today's version of the shop in 1951. He **envisaged** the shop as a "socialist utopia masquerading as a bookstore": writers are invited to sleep for free among the shelves in exchange for a few hours helping out, and more than 30, 000 of the guests, named "tumbleweeds" by Whitman, have stayed since the store opened.

​		Since appealing to customers on Wednesday morning, Whitman said the shop had been **deluged** with offers of support — and more importantly orders.

​		The appeal follows a similar move from iconic New York bookshop the Strand, which said last week that the impact of Covid-19 meant that "we cannot survive the huge decline in foot traffic, a near-complete loss of tourism and zero in-store events."Nancy Bass-Wyden, **proprietor** of the 93-year-old American store, said revenue was down nearly 70% from 2019, and that "we are now at a turning point where our business is unsustainable".
