## Japan's most polarizing superfood?

​		Nattō is a traditional Japanese food made from **fermented soybeans**. It has an ammonia-like smell and **mucus**-like consistency that makes it polarizing, even among people who grow up with it. A 2017 survey by Nifty, a Japanese internet service provider, found that only about 62% of Japanese people actually enjoy nattō. It also revealed that 13% actively dislike the taste. Regardless, many eat it anyway because of the health benefits.

​		The Japanese have long **hailed** nattō as a superfood and believe that consumption is linked to improved blood flow and reduced risk of stroke — factors that are particularly appealing in a country that is home to one of the world’s oldest populations. Researchers at the National Cancer Center in Tokyo found that men and women who ate fermented soy-based foods like nattō on a daily basis reduced their risk of dying from a stroke or heart attack by 10%.

​		Nattō might even help people feel and look younger. One serving (roughly 40-50g) has the same levels of vitamin K as the daily requirement set by the Japanese government and may help prevent **osteoporosis**.

​		Nattō is also packed with vitamin B6 and vitamin E, which Hitoshi Shirakawa, professor of nutrition and food science at Tohoku University's Graduate School of Agricultural Science in Sendai, says boosts cell turnover and slows skin aging.

​		Despite its reputation as a superfood, however, nattō has failed to gain popularity outside of Japan. It has, however, attracted enough attention to end up in the Disgusting Food Museum in Malmö, Sweden.
“What we find disgusting and delicious is very cultural, ” said museum director Andreas Ahrens.“It all depends on what we grew up with and what we are conditioned to like. Something like nattō is a very good example of that.”
