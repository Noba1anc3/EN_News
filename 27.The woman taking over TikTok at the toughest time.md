## The woman taking over TikTok at the toughest time

​		Six weeks ago, as TikTok grappled with escalating tensions between the United States and China, the social media app’s top executives huddled together to figure out their next steps.

​		Vanessa Pappas, 41, was worried. TikTok's North American business, which she has run since 2018, was dealing with an **uproar**. Last month, Pappas was appointed TikTok's **interim** global head, just as the app faces an even **murkier** future.

interim  暂时的; 过渡的

murkier  浑浊的; 污浊的; 昏暗的

​		Pappas said she is focused on what TikTok's future could look like if the app's ownership is bifurcated. Most of all, she said, she is doubling down on putting TikTok's community of creators and users — ranging from those who post videos of cake decorating to those who break dance — first.

​		Tom Keiser, chief executive of Hootsuite, a social media management company, said TikTok was right to make its power users a priority.

​		"They need to be investing in those folks, " he said."There's so many things out of their control, but their future growth is based on influencers and content creators continuing to evolve and grow and leverage the new capabilities TikTok is rolling out."

​		Pappas has worked in the online influencer world since some of its earliest days. In 2011, She joined YouTube and quickly rose through the ranks. Her division at YouTube developed and popularized the term "creator" and helped transform vlogging into a full-time job.

​		TikTok lured her from YouTube at the end of 2018. It was a new challenge for Pappas, who said she had wanted to get in on the ground floor of the next big creator movement.
