## Chang'e-5: why has China sent a probe to the moon

​		China has successfully landed a probe on the moon. There, the unmanned Chang'e-5 will prepare to collect the first lunar samples gathered since the Soviet Union's Luna 24 mission in 1976. Here is everything you need to know:

​		Why has China gone to the moon?

​		China hopes to operate a permanent space station called Tiangong — planned for as early as 2022 — and send astronauts to the moon, as part of the country's "space dream".

​		As part of China's space plans, it launched a new rocket and prototype spacecraft in May, called the Long March 5B. China hopes that one day craft like these will take a crew of six to the space station.

​		The Chang'e-5 mission provides an opportunity to test equipment and procedures before the next Tiangong phase.

​		What will the moon rocks be used for?

​		The 2kg of material — dust and debris — the probe is expected to collect will help scientists learn about the moon's origins, formation and volcanic activity on its surface, according to AFP.

​		Xiao Long, a planetary geologist at the China University of Geosciences in Wuhan, told Nature that the samples could "rewrite the history of the moon" if they show that there was still volcanic activity on the moon's surface 1bn-2bn years ago. Previous lunar material suggests this activity stopped around 3.5bn years ago, according to Nature.

​		How long will this mission take?

​		Chang'e-5 needs to complete its mission within one lunar day, the equivalent of 14 days on Earth, so that it does not have to withstand too many of the moon's extreme overnight temperatures.
