## What did Europe smell like centuries ago? Historians set out to re-create lost smells

​		For hundreds of years, through plagues and other pandemics, people used to believe that disease was spread not through droplets or **flea** bites, but through the **inhalation** of unpleasant odors. To purify the air around them, they would burn rosemary and hot **tar**.

​		Now, as the world confronts another widespread outbreak, a team of historians and scientists from six European countries is seeking to identify and categorize the most common scents of daily life across Europe from the 16th century to the early 20th century and to study what changes in scents over time reveal about society.

​		The $3.3 million "Odeuropa" project, which was announced this week, will use artificial intelligence to **sift** through more than 250, 000 images and thousands of texts. Researchers will use machine learning and artificial intelligence to train computers to analyze references in texts to smells, like **incense** and tobacco.

​		Once cataloged, researchers, working with chemists and perfumers, will re-create roughly 120 scents with the hope that museum **curators** will incorporate some of the odors into exhibits to make visits more immersive or memorable for museumgoers.

​		The three-year project, which is funded by the European Union, will also include a guide for how museums can use smells in exhibits. The use of smells in exhibits could also make museums more accessible for people who are blind or who have limited sight, historians said.

​		Researchers are not just interested in studying the good aromas of past centuries but also the bad smells, like **dung** or the **stenches** of industrialization and the **sewage** issues that plagued some European cities. They, too, can be dispensed in museums to help people connect with the past.
