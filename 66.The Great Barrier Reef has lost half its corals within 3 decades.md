## The Great Barrier Reef has lost half its corals within 3 decades

​		Australia's Great Barrier **Reef** has lost 50% of its **coral** populations in the last three decades, with climate change a key driver of reef disturbance, a new study has found.

reef  礁

coral  珊瑚

​		Researchers from the ARC Center of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, in Queensland, northeastern Australia, assessed coral communities and their colony size along the length of the Great Barrier Reef between 1995 and 2017, finding **depletion** of **virtually** all coral populations, they said Tuesday.

depletion  耗尽; 亏损

virtually  几乎; 差不多; 实际上; 虚拟

​		Reefs are fundamental to the health of marine ecosystems — without them, ecosystems collapse, and marine life dies.

​		Population declines occurred in both shallow and deep water coral species, experts found, but branching and table-shaped corals — which provide habitats for fish — were worst affected by mass **bleaching** events in 2016 and 2017, triggered by record-breaking temperatures.

bleach  漂白; 褪色

​		Warm ocean temperatures are the main driver of coral bleaching. Bleaching doesn't kill coral immediately, but if temperatures remain high, eventually the coral will die, destroying a natural habitat for many species of marine life.

​		The Great Barrier Reef has suffered several mass bleaching events in the past five years, and experts said the southern part of the reef was also exposed to record-breaking temperatures in early 2020.

​		"We used to think the Great Barrier Reef is protected by its sheer size — but our results show that even the world's largest and relatively well-protected reef system is increasingly compromised and in decline, " Terry Hughes, a **distinguished** professor at the ARC Center of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, said.

distinguished  卓越的; 杰出的

​		"There is no time to lose — we must sharply decrease greenhouse gas emissions ASAP, " the report authors warned in the paper, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society journal.
