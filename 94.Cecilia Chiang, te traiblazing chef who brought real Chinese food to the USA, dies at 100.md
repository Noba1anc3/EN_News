## Cecilia Chiang, the trailblazing chef who brought real Chinese food to the USA, dies at 100

​		San Francisco chef Cecilia Chiang, who `blazed a trail` for Chinese cuisine in the United States, died Wednesday. She was 100.

trailblazing  开拓的; 先驱的

blazed a trail  开辟道路

​		Chiang was the owner, chef and mastermind behind the game-changing San Francisco restaurant, the Mandarin. She is widely `credited with` bringing real Chinese food to America and was a celebrity chef before celebrity chefs were popularized.

​		Chiang, who was born near Shanghai, came from an upper-class Chinese family. Although she wasn't shy about acknowledging her good fortune, she faced other, perhaps more hard-won obstacles.

​		Convincing the dining public that Chinese food didn't have to be Thursday's cheap take-out option, Chiang, who moved to the Bay Area in 1959, had her work cut out for her. She insisted on showing diners the **refined** side of Chinese food and wanted to upgrade the Chinese dining experience. To do this, she also needed to be `hyperaware` of aesthetics.

refine  精炼; 提纯; 优雅

​		The Mandarin did not serve chop suey or chow mien, two standard dishes on every Chinese restaurant in the US at the time. But this is exactly what Chiang wanted to avoid. In fact, her early brushes with Chinese food in America had left her determined to show San Francisco what Chinese food was really like.
"She deliberately and unceasingly championed outsiders trying to make their mark in food, " her granddaughter, Siena Chiang said."I hope she is a signal and an inspiration to people with `marginalized identities` to always believe in your own worth and knowledge, and to be uncompromising about your culture."
