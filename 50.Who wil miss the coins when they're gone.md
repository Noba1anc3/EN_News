## Who will miss the coins when they're gone

​		Coins are everywhere until they're nowhere, and at the moment they're hard to find. By upending normal habits, the pandemic has dropped them out of circulation and accelerated a trend toward cards, apps and other cashless payments that could eventually make coins **obsolete**.

obsolete  淘汰的; 废弃的

​		For banks and credit card companies, the **demise** of each unit of cash would be welcome news. For small businesses that rely on coins, it's a slow-rolling earthquake.

demise  终止; 失败

​		As the coin shortage reached its worst in June, trade groups for grocers, gas stations and convenience stores pleaded for help from the government, calling the coin shortage an emergency that threatened their ability to serve customers and stay in business.

​		"The economy is **bifurcating**, sort of splitting in two parts, and there's one part that's taking a beating, " said Jay Zagorsky, a professor at Boston University.

bifurcate  分叉; 分支

​		However, coins will always have defenders in curators and collectors. Dr. Fleur Kemmers, an **archaeologist** at Goethe University Frankfurt, called ancient coins "historic documents, " passed down by people across centuries and continents as they **haggled**, **hoarded** and made their way through daily life."They are **tangible** remains of past regimes, yet also part of the daily lives of ordinary people 2, 000 years ago, " she said.

​		Then as now, they became part of little rituals, symbols and gestures. Fearing bad luck, some don't pick up a penny unless it's heads-up. For centuries, people have tossed coins into wishing wells, or now their urban equivalent, the city fountain.

​		But Kemmers said that aside from their symbolism, she was "not that optimistic about the `long-term` future of coins." With one exception: "Commemorative coins might be something that will last."
