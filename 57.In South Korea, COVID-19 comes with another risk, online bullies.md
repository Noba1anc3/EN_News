## In South Korea, COVID-19 comes with another risk: online bullies

​		The scandal that riveted South Korea's online **busybodies** began when Kim Ji-seon checked into a beachside **condominium** in February. A 29-year-old office worker planning a wedding, she had nothing more **salacious** in mind than meeting with members of her church to organize a youth program.

​		Then Kim tested positive for the coronavirus. South Korean authorities publicly revealed Kim's age, gender, church name and recent whereabouts. **Extrapolating** from these details, online **trolls** matched her **itinerary** with that of another church member who had tested positive and concluded she was cheating on her **fiance**.

​		Governments around the world have **grappled** with misinformation and **outright** lies about the coronavirus. In South Korea, that struggle has become uniquely personal.

​		In the initial desperate months of the pandemic, government websites uploaded a detailed sketch of each patient's daily life until they were diagnosed and isolated. That rush of data fed a growing culture of online harassment.

​		In South Korea, doxxing had already been a growing problem. As the stories of abuse **mounted**, the government pulled back on some of its disclosures. As the virus has resurged in recent months, authorities have cracked down on spreading disinformation or leaking personal data and have **interrogated** 202 people for related criminal activity.

​		Still, authorities are trying to balance privacy with safety. Police have asked prosecutors to indict 13 people accused of providing false information, including several who lied to epidemiological investigators about their health or the places they visited.
