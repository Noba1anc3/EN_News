## Does our tech match past sci-fi marvels

​		The film "Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet" (1965) was set in 2020, and imagined humankind as having mastered space travel, zipping off to fight man-eating plants on the surface of Venus. **Likewise**, "Back to the Future, Part II" (1989) assumed that, by 2015, consumers would be able to buy hoverboards that actually **defied** gravity.

likewise  同样地

defy  反抗; 顶住

​		Which other technological marvels have failed to **materialize**, and what is the scientific reality?

materialize  实现; 发生

​		Jet packs

​		It has been 92 years since the August cover of "Amazing Stories" magazine featured a man in a **scarlet** jumpsuit floating over the sky. Today, they exist: You can reserve a wearable **turbine** T-73 from Jetpack International for a very reasonable $200, 000.

scarlet  猩红的; 鲜红的

turbine  涡轮机

​		Androids

​		It's nearly 50 years since Michael Crichton directed "Westworld, " adapted from his novel about a dust-bowl theme park whose chief robot **cowpoke** turns rogue and begins **dueling** for real.

cowpoke  牛仔

duel  决斗; 竞争

​		**Androids** that convincing might not yet walk among us, but they certainly exist, **albeit** in a more **benevolent** form. At the Kodaiji Buddhist temple in Kyoto, Japan, **enlightenment** seekers can enjoy sermons **preached** by Mindar, a robot speaking as Kannon Bodhisattva, the Buddhist **deity** of mercy.

Android  人形机器人

albeit  尽管; 虽然

benevolent  慈善的 ; 仁慈的

​		Hoverboards

​		When imagining 2015, the screenwriters for "Back to the Future, Part II" got some lucky picks: **gargantuan** TVs and **thumbprint** transactions. But the levitating hoverboards, whispered to be real at the time of the film's production, are still just a pipe dream.

gargantuan  巨大的;庞大的

thumbprint  指纹

​		That didn't stop French inventor Franky Zapata attempting to cross the English Channel on a hoverboard last year. It might not have been the model as flown by Michael J. Fox in the movie, but it allowed its pilot to float from Calais to Dover in 22 minutes.
