## China approves Covid-19 vaccine as it moves to inoculate millions

​		The Chinese government said on Thursday that it had approved a homegrown coronavirus vaccine after an early analysis of clinical trial results showed that it was effective. The announcements sent a positive signal for the global rollout of Chinese vaccines.

​		The manufacturer, a state-controlled firm called Sinopharm, said a vaccine candidate made by its Beijing Institute of Biological Products arm had an efficacy rate of 79 percent based on an **interim** analysis of Phase 3 trials. Sinopharm said it had filed an application with Chinese regulators to allow the vaccine to be used broadly, and on Thursday the government said the vaccine had been granted conditional approval.

​		The Sinopharm vaccine's results are well above the 50 percent threshold that makes a vaccine effective in the eyes of the medical establishment. To China, a vaccine that can help protect its 1.4 billion people is crucial to its plans to revitalize the economy.

​		The country has largely stamped out the coronavirus with a combination of restrictions on foreign arrivals, mass testing and tight lockdowns of neighborhoods whenever any cases are detected. But officials remain concerned that the winter could bring a new wave of infections and hope that a widely available vaccine can help prepare the country for when regular travel and trade resume.

​		The Chinese government has promised to produce 610 million doses by the end of the year and expects to make more than one billion doses next year.
