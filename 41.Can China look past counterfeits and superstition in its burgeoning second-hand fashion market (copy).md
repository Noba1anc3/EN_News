## In Afghanistan, fears of assassination overshadow hopes of peace

​		Last week, 34-year-old journalist Elyas Dayee became the latest Afghan killed in a nationwide campaign of targeted killings, when a bomb twisted his car into a **lethal** pile of metal and glass.

​		Around the country, journalists, human rights workers, moderate religious scholars and civil society activists have been picked off as they go about their daily lives, often blown up in their cars.

​		The **steady** drum beat of killings has cast a shadow of fear across the country, even as the government and Taliban are meant to be hammering out a peace deal. Many people see a connection between the two, even though the attacks have not all been claimed by the insurgents.

​		"Even if we only assume the Taliban are responsible for part of them, the message is clear: 'Be prepared for our rule, be prepared to surrender, we are coming back', " said Orzala Ashraf Nemat, the director of the Kabul-based thinktank AREU.

​		"It is to discourage the united struggle for `democratic values`, `freedom of speech`, education, even the enlightening side of religious scholarship. They are trying to do these attacks to create fear because their rule is fear-based."

​		The deaths have left a pall of uncertainty across swathes of Afghan society, with thousands of people questioning if they could be targets because they work in professions or in conditions that the Taliban want to curtail or abolish should they regain power in Kabul.

​		The killings also undermine already **shaky** confidence in the central government. Shaharzad Akbar, the head of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, has called on the government to take stronger steps to investigate the killings.
