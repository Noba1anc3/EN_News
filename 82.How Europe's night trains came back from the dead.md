## How Europe's night trains came back from the dead

​		Going to bed in one major city and waking up in another; **toasting** the landscape as a new country slips past; being rocked to sleep as you rattle across a continent. It's no wonder that the night trains of Europe have been a **byword** for romance, **immortalized** by writers such as Agatha Christie.

immortal  永恒的；不朽的

​		In fact, over the past decade, much of Europe's night train network has been cut. For many, it seemed the end of the line was **nigh**. But recently there has been a resurgence of night trains across Europe. On December 8, four national rail providers teamed up to announce new routes between 13 European cities.

nigh  几乎；差不多

​		"You leave work at a normal time, have dinner, make your way to the station, get on the train, and wake up in the place you want to be. There's no turning up at the airport at an **unearthly** hour, as you do for a **budget** flight." says Monisha Rajesh, author of "Around the World in 80 Trains."

​		In fact, "flight shaming" has been sweeping across Europe in the past few years. In 2018, domestic flights were down 9% in Sweden.

​		The Covid-19 pandemic has helped, too. Trains are easier to social-distance on, says Rajesh. And night trains — where you can book an entire compartment to yourself — are even better.

​		Europe's geography also helps the argument for night trains, says Nicolas Forien, part of **Back on Track**, who points out that half the flights departing France are either internal, or going to a neighboring country."The distance between European capitals is mostly ideal for night trains. The continent could be a night-train paradise."
