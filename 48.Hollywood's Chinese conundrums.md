## Hollywood's Chinese conundrums

​		Disney, Hollywood's biggest film studio, has spent five years and $200m on the live-action remake of its 22-year-old animation, "Mulan", in the hope of conquering the Chinese box office.

conundrum  难题

​		Hollywood has reason to look across the Pacific. In the past 15 years China's box-office takings have risen 35-fold, to $9.7bn. That is not far off America's $11.1bn. This year receipts have sunk as covid-19 forced cinemas to shut. But they may fall a bit less **precipitously** in China. China may emerge from the pandemic with the world's biggest box office.

precipitous  陡峭的

​		By 2007 American studios ruled the Chinese box office, making 16 of the 25 highest-grossing films. In the past few years, though, Chinese studios have grown less **infatuated** with Hollywood — and more **sophisticated**.

infatuated  热恋的; 痴迷的

sophisticated  老练的; 成熟的

​		In a reversal of fortunes from a decade ago, 17 of the 25 highest-grossing films in China were Chinese, including eight in the top ten.

​		Audiences in big Chinese cities like Beijing and Shanghai can relate to Western fare, but people in smaller, provincial cities do not. And they are the fastest-growing audience: third-tier and fourth-tier cities, account for 40% and rising of China's box office, according to Maoyan, a ticketing platform.

​		In China ticket sales have begun to slow as more people plump for local streaming services such as iQiyi and Tencent Video. At the cinema audiences often **soak up** stories from all over the world. As they turn to streaming they more often consume content tailored to their country.

 soak up  吸收; 沉浸于

​		The cultural and commercial **tussle** for global imaginations goes on for now. But one day it may see Americans and Chinese mutually retreat to their own, national, small screens.

tussle  扭打; 争斗
