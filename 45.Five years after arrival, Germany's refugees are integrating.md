## Five years after arrival, Germany's refugees are integrating

​		On August 31st 2015, with a growing number of **asylum**-seekers reaching Germany, Angela Merkel declared: "Wir schaffen das" (roughly, "We can handle this"). A few days later the chancellor opened the borders to migrants **stranded** in Budapest, amplifying the wave: perhaps 1.2m reached Germany before Balkan border closures and a deal with Turkey in 2016 **stemmed** the flow. Initially Germany handled the migrants well. Yet five years on, its experience of integrating them has been mixed.

​		Start with jobs. In 2015 an **influx** of mainly young migrants looked a neat fit for German firms facing an aging labor force. Rules were eased for asylum-seekers looking for jobs, and the government pushed 1.1m through integration and language courses.

influx  涌入; 流入

​		The headline figure **conceals** some awkward details. Barely half the refugees in Germany's labor force today work in skilled jobs, although over 80% did in their home countries.

conceal  隐藏; 遮盖

​		Like many European countries Germany has struggled to deport failed asylum-seekers. More than 200, 000 people have been granted Duldung ("tolerated") status, meaning they have no right to be in the country but do not face immediate deportation. Perhaps a further 50, 000 have no legal status.

​		A poll last year found a majority of Germans thought the country should accept no more refugees. These days the borders are quieter and the issue has gone off the boil, but fresh waves of migrants from Europe's troubled neighborhood can hardly be ruled out."Mama" Merkel, as she is known to many refugees, long ago abandoned her "Wir schaffen das" mantra for a more **paradoxical** claim: that her decision to leave the borders open was correct, and must never be repeated.
