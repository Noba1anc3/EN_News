## The battle within the electric-vehicle industry will intensify

​		Like the move from horse-drawn **carriages** to contraptions powered by internal-**combustion** engines, the migration from cars powered by fossil fuels to electric vehicles (EVs) will have a profound effect on personal transport. Covid-19 caused a 20% drop in global light-vehicle sales in 2020, to about 70m, but they will pick up in 2021. And, the pro­portion of vehicles powered by batteries will grow quickly.

combustion  燃烧

​		The surging share price of Tesla, provides a big incentive for **incumbents** and newcomers to catch up. Tesla may lead in battery technology and software, but to make those advantages stick, it must prove that "production hell" is behind it. Scaling up manufacturing has caused Tesla its biggest headaches.

incumbent  在职的；现任的

​		Established carmakers face an equally **daunting** challenge: learning how to write software. Electric cars require integrated software, not just to ensure that batteries and motors work together to provide the best performance, but to connect the car to the outside world.

daunting  令人望而生畏的

​		And what of the Tesla **wannabes**, from China's Li, Nio and Xpeng to American firms such as Fisker, Lucid and Nikola? Cash from excitable investors has poured in and established carmakers are also taking stakes—as are tech giants, keen to get involved as transport goes digital. Can the wannabes persuade investors that they have **proprietary** technology that will give them a long-term advantage?

proprietary  专利的；所有的

​		**Flashy** launches of vehicles are one thing, but as the industry's **travails** show, working out how to make cars at scale, when bits and bytes are as important as brakes and **bodywork**, is quite another. The coming year will make clearer which of Tesla’s competitors, new and old, can stay in the race.
