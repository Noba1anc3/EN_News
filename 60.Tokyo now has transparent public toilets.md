## Tokyo now has transparent public toilets

​		Public toilets around the globe have a reputation for being dark, dirty and dangerous. Tokyo recently unveiled new restrooms in two public parks that aim to address those concerns. For one thing, they are brightly lit and colorful. For another, they are transparent. This way, those who need to go can check out the cleanliness and safety of the stalls without having to walk inside or touch a thing.

​		Japan has long experimented with toilets, resulting in lids that open and close automatically and seats that warm up. But the new stalls — designed by Shigeru Ban, the Pritzker Prize-winning architect — are made out of an **opacity**-changing "smart glass".

​		The toilets were installed in Tokyo this month, coinciding with a nationwide campaign to phase out the city's old-fashioned public toilets ahead of the now-delayed Summer Olympics. Set up in front of a cluster of trees in the Shibuya district, the stalls stand out like a Mondrian painting.

​		When occupied and locked properly, the tinted glass toilet stalls become frosted and **opaque**. When the door is unlocked, an electric current realigns the crystals in the glass to allow more light to pass through, creating a transparent effect. The toilets were presented as another futuristic and aesthetically pleasing example of the country's technological advancements.

​		A predecessor to Tokyo's transparent toilets appeared in Switzerland in 2002, when designer Olivier Rambert unveiled two glass bathrooms in the city of Lausanne. They had a safety feature that automatically opened the doors and turned the glass transparent if sensors detected no motion for 10 minutes. That could conceivably help users who fall unconscious and need medical attention.
