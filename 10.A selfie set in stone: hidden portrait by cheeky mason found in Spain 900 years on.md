## A selfie set in stone: hidden portrait by cheeky mason found in Spain 900 years on

​		He is a medieval in-joke, a male figure carved in the early 12th century for one of the world's greatest cathedrals, but no one has known of his existence until now.

​		The figure has gone unnoticed by millions of worshippers who have made the long **pilgrimage** to Santiago de Compostela in Galicia over the centuries. He has looked down on them from the top of one of the many pillars that soar upwards, each decorated with carved **foliage**, among which he is concealed.
Now he has been discovered by a British art scholar Jennifer Alexander who believes that he was actually never meant to be seen because he is a self-portrait of a stonemason who worked on the cathedral in the 12th century.

​		Despite the supreme talent of such craftsmen, they were completely anonymous, their names lost to history. This is the closest the mason got to signing his work.

​		Alexander was conducting a stone-by-stone analysis to work out the cathedral's construction sequence. It was when she was studying the capitals, about 13 meters above the pavement, that "this little figure popped out", she recalled.

​		"He's got a nice little smile. He's pleased with himself. He's **splendidly** carved, with a strongly characterized face."

​		Medieval stonemasons learned their craft through **apprenticeships** that trained them in the back-breaking trade. Alexander said: "These masters had to have many skills since they were also responsible for engineering, supply of materials, hiring the workforce and dealing with the **patron**."

​		She added that such craftsmen have remained anonymous throughout the centuries even into more recent times: "So these are the unsung geniuses."
