## Why is Pixar so brilliant at death

​		There comes a time in the life of a writer, director and, perhaps, a company when the days shorten, the shadows lengthen and **contemplating** the inevitable must begin. The guy in the cloak with the **retro** lawn equipment can't be ignored any longer: Death.

contemplate  考虑；沉思

retro  复古；怀旧

​		In Pixar's latest film, Soul, **mortality** springs itself with supreme bad timing on **protagonist** Joe Gardner, a New York jazzman about to play the gig of his life when he falls down a manhole.

protagonist  主人公

​		Death has always **lurked** in Pixar's filmography. The driving motor of the Toy Story films is Woody's fear that he may become redundant as his owners grow older. In toy terms, this is death.

​		Dealing with death in recent films, Pixar has preferred to hew close to JM Barrie's "awfully big adventure" line, with Coco and Soul making death just another big playground for kids to explore.

​		Pixar understands this theme so well because the birth of the company itself signified a moment of pop-culture **obsolescence**. Toy Story is **suffused** with **nostalgia**, for the era of **wholesome** postwar entertainment that the likes of Woody and Bo-Peep represent.

obsolescence  过时；淘汰

suffuse  弥漫；充满

nostalgia  怀旧

wholesome  有益健康的；道德的

​		Consumers expect far more these days, and Hollywood's digital CGI **wizards** can conjure up anything to match our expectations. Pixar is part of the same San Francisco Silicon Valley elite that is busy trying to "cure" death. Maybe depicting that great intangible is the one remaining frontier for its entertainment arm to conquer.

​		And Covid-19 could just be the 21st-century's amuse-bouche for even greater environmental catastrophe. Pixar's articles of faith are strong in the face of such darkness.
