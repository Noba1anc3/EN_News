## How the 'durian of soup' became the hippest dish in China

​		Unusual foods often gain **cult** followings. But it's rare for an **odorous** dish to become a national favorite, which is exactly what's happened with luosifen. Just like the notorious durian fruit, this snail-based **rice noodle** soup dish has `created a buzz` on Chinese social media `thanks to` its **infamous** smell.

cult  狂热，时尚，崇拜

odorous  有气味的

rice noodle  米粉

​		It features rice vermicelli **soaked** in a spicy broth, topped with locally grown ingredients including bamboo shoots, string beans, turnips, peanuts and **tofu skin**.

​		By 2010, luosifen had already earned a following after being featured in hit **culinary** documentary "A Bite of China." In 2014, Liuzhou entrepreneurs had an idea: `Mass produce` the noodles and package them.

culinary  烹饪的; 食物的

​		Though it admittedly draws inspiration from convenience food, packaged luosifen shouldn't be classed as such, says Ni Diaoyang, head of the Liuzhou Luosifen Association. Instead, he prefers to refer to it as a "local **specialty** food, " because neither the quality nor the freshness has been compromised.

specialty  专业; 专长

​		Rather than adding flavoring powders, the luosifen broth — often **condensed** in packets — is created through protracted cooking processes, with bulks of snails, chicken bones and pig marrow bones sitting in rolling boils for more than 10 hours.

condensed  压缩的，精简的; (液体)浓缩的

​		The luosifen **frenzy** in China has been **propelled** by pop culture — including culinary shows and mukbang videos.

frenzy  疯狂; 狂乱

propel  推动; 驱动

​		Having already taken China by storm, the dish is now gaining fans in the rest of the world. According to the in-house research arm of Alibaba, packaged luosifen has already been sold to more than 100 countries or regions. From January to August, international sales hit $3.1 million — 22 times their total export value in 2019.
