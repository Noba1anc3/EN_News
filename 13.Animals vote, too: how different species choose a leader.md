## Animals vote, too: how different species choose a leader

​		Americans are currently deciding who they think will best serve them as leader. While animals don't emerge from polling places with the "I Voted" sticker, they make `collective decisions` about who's going to `take charge`, too.

​		Honeybees

​		"In honeybees, when a vote happens about when to move a hive from one area to another, it is very much a democracy, " says Jennifer Smith, an animal behaviorist at Mills College in Oakland, California. The queen bee takes flight with about half the hive's workforce and settles on a staging spot, perhaps a tree branch. From this **vantage point**, several hundred worker bee scouts search for an appropriate new abode.

vantage point  有利地点

​		When a scout finds one, it returns to the group and performs a "waggle dance".The more a bee shakes its stuff, the more `promising` it thinks the site it explored is. If the bee's dance is **vigorous** enough, other scouts will locate and assess the location.

vigorous  充满活力的; 果断的

​		Indian jumping ants

​		Indian jumping ants live in colonies in which individuals have clearly delineated roles. Worker ants build nests and keep them clean while a queen lays eggs to `maintain the population`. But when an Indian jumping ant queen dies, all hell breaks loose: prospective leaders face off in antennal fencing **duels**.

duel  决斗

​		During this battle royale ants **scuffle** with other for months of heated conflict, and about a dozen queen candidates rise to the top. This new group picks up the late queen's **scepter**, turning to their newfound role as egg-laying machines.
