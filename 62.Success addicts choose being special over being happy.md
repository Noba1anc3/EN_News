## Success addicts choose being special over being happy

​		Though it isn't a conventional medical addiction, for many people success has addictive properties. To a certain extent, praise stimulates the **neurotransmitter** **dopamine**, which is **implicated** in all addictive behaviors.

dopamine  多巴胺

implicate  牵涉; 涉及

​		The desire for success may be inherent to human nature, but specialness doesn't come cheap. Success is brutal work, and it requires sacrifices. In the 1980s, the physician Robert Goldman famously found that more than half of aspiring athletes would be willing to take a drug that would kill them in five years in exchange for winning every competition they entered.

​		Unfortunately, success is **Sisyphean**. The goal can't be satisfied; most people never feel "successful enough."The high only lasts a day or two, and then it's on to the next goal. Psychologists call this the **hedonic** **treadmill**, in which satisfaction wears off almost immediately and we must run on to the next reward to avoid the feeling of falling behind.

Sisyphean  永无止境的

hedonic  享乐主义的

treadmill  枯燥无味的工作; 跑步机

​		People should get off the treadmill. But quitting isn't easy for addicts. For people hooked on substances, withdrawal can be an agonizing experience, both physically and psychologically.

​		A research finds that depression and anxiety are common among elite athletes after their careers end. Olympic athletes, in particular, suffer from the "post-Olympic blues."

​		Success in and of itself is not a bad thing, any more than wine is a bad thing. Both can bring fun and sweetness to life. But both become **tyrannical** when they are a substitute for — instead of a complement to — the relationships and love that should be at the center of our lives.

tyrannical  残暴的; 专横的
