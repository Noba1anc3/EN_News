## 'Three little pigs': Musks's Neuralink puts computer chips in animal brains

​		Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's neuroscience startup Neuralink on Friday unveiled a pig that has had a coin-sized computer chip in its brain for two months, showing off an early step toward the goal of curing human diseases with the same type of **implant**.

implant  灌输; 植入

​		Neuralink aims to implant wireless brain-computer interfaces that include thousands of electrodes in the most complex human organ to help cure neurological conditions like Alzheimer's, **dementia** and **spinal cord** injuries.

dementia  痴呆; 精神错乱

spinal cord  脊髓

​		"An implantable device can actually solve these problems, " Musk said on a webcast Friday, mentioning ailments such as memory loss, hearing loss, depression and insomnia.

​		Musk did not provide a timeline for those treatments, appearing to retreat from earlier statements that human trials would begin by the end of this year. Neuralink's first clinical trials with a small number of human patients would be aimed at treating paralysis or paraplegia, the company's head surgeon Dr. Matthew MacDougall said.

​		Neuroscientists unaffiliated with the company said the presentation indicated that Neuralink had made great strides but cautioned that longer studies were needed. Some researchers said longer studies would be required to determine the **longevity** of the device.

longevity  长寿; 持久

​		Small devices that electronically stimulate nerves and brain areas to treat hearing loss and Parkinson's disease have been implanted in humans for decades. Brain implant trials have also been conducted with a small number of people who have lost control of bodily functions.
