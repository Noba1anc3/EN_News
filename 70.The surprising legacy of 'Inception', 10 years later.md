## The surprising legacy of 'Inception', 10 years later

​		A year after the release of his 2010 film, "Inception", Christopher Nolan invited some of the movie industry's most **prominent** directors to a special screening. He took the stage and said, "I have an **ulterior** motive for bringing you here, " before arguing for the importance of directors shooting films on celluloid, rather than adapting to the new norm of using digital cameras.

prominent  著名的

ulterior  隐秘的; 不可告人的

​		It was the first time the director **assumed** the **mantle** of defending cinematic traditions."Inception", which just celebrated its 10th anniversary, was the project that invested him with that authority. It was a wholly original blockbuster, featuring one of the biggest movie stars (Leonardo DiCaprio) in the world. And it made more than $800 million globally.

​		Nolan has publicly **shouldered** the same intense responsibility that he took on after the release of "Inception" since the spread of COVID-19 closed most theaters. This time, the issue isn't the future of celluloid — rather, it's the future of cinemas following months of lost grosses.

shoulder  承担

​		Nolan and his team have pushed to get his newest release, "Tenet", in theaters as soon as possible, in hopes of throwing a lifeline to struggling businesses. He also wrote a March 20 op-ed in "The Washington Post" calling on the American government to help preserve movie theaters."Inception" begins with Cobb arguing that an idea is more **resilient** than a virus. The coming months will be a test of that optimistic vision.
