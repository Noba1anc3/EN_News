## The Guardian view on African success: a step closer to conquering polio

​		**Polio** is transmitted by poor **hygiene** and largely affects children under five. In 5-10% of cases, the virus affects the nerves, paralyzing the legs in particular. For most, this is temporary. For others – 30 years ago, this was 350, 000 children a year – paralysis is permanent, and if it is of the lungs, they die.

polio  脊髓灰质炎; 小儿麻痹

hygiene  卫生

​		In the early 20th century epidemics were frequent. When, in 1955, a vaccine was developed, the British held street parties. Polio was declared gone in the Americas in 1994; in the western Pacific region in 2000; in Europe in 2002; India and south-east Asia in 2014. Last week, Africa joined their number.

​		The global project has involved 20 million volunteers vaccinating nearly 3 billion children. It is an amazing achievement. But it is still fragile, for a number of reasons.

​		First, what is being eradicated is wild polio. It’s still possible to get vaccine-derived polio, where the much-**diluted** active components spread through an under-vaccinated community and, in rare cases, **revert** to the full-blown disease.

dilute  稀释; 削弱

revert  恢复; 回到; 归还

​		Second is disruption. In Africa, the last 1% proved hardest partly because of war and anti-vaccination sentiment.

​		Third, **eradication** is in its final, most delicate, stage. The vaccine, a droplet-administered method that contains active virus and **confers** lifelong immunity, must eventually be replaced by injections of inactive strains in order to cancel all risk of vaccine-derived polio virus.

eradication  根除; 消灭

confer  授予; 商讨

​		In this year, there is much that feels familiar about the story of polio — from **stealthy** **onset** to hopes for a vaccine, to worries about anti-vaxxers. But we must take other lessons too: that eradication could take years of patient **vigilance**. That we are capable of great things. And that we must be prepared.

stealthy  秘密的; 不声张的

onset  开端; 发生

vigilance  警惕; 戒备; 失眠症
