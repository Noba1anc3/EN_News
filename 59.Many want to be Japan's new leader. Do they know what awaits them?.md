## Many want to be Japan's new leader. Do they know what awaits them?

​		The Japanese economy has taken a historic **nosedive**. The coronavirus could yet rage out of control and force a second postponement of the Olympics. America, Japan's closest ally, is **embroiled** in a polarizing presidential election. And those are just the immediate challenges for the politicians jockeying fiercely to replace Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is leaving office a year early with no obvious successor.

​		Japan is confronting labor shortages as it **grapples** with a shrinking population and a stubbornly low birthrate, as well as **snags** in bringing in foreign workers.

snag  问题; 困难

​		"It makes me wonder why anybody would want to be prime minister, " said Jeffrey Hornung, an analyst at the RAND Corp.

​		But there is no shortage of **aspirants**. Abe's conservative party, the Liberal Democratic Party, will announce on Tuesday whether it will call an extraordinary election limited to its members of Parliament and a few prefectural representatives, or a vote that would involve all the party's 1 million members.

​		For now, the most pressing priority for the next prime minister will be restoring the economy, **battered** by a worldwide pandemic-related downturn. Japan already has the biggest debt load in the developed world relative to the size of its economy and has spent heavily to **stimulate** economic activity.

battered  破旧不堪的

stimulate  促进; 刺激

​		"This is such a heavy lift even before you get to structural change and demographics or any of these larger Japan-specific problems, " said Sheila A. Smith, senior fellow for Japan studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington.
