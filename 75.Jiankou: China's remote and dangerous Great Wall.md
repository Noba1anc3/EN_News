## Jiankou: China's remote and dangerous Great Wall

​		The Great Wall of China, which winds for 21, 000km across the north of the country, is one of humanity's most **renowned** creations. It was named a Unesco World Heritage site in 1987. When tourists come to Beijing, they head by busload to the wall's most famous outposts. Few of them come here.

​		The Jiankou section of the wall ribbons over the top of **jagged** green mountains for 20km. From the valley below, it looks like icing piped onto each peak.

jagged  锯齿状的

​		It is completely different from its better-known neighbours, like Badaling or Mutianyu. There is no souvenir shop or Starbucks, no cable car or gondola. To access this section of the wall, you must hike 45 minutes up a mountain.

​		And there was — until recently — no restoration. Built in the 1500s and early 1600s, this section was left untouched for centuries. Over time, the towers melted into mounds of rubble. Some parts of the wall **tumbled** down completely, rendering once-wide sections so narrow that only one person could walk at a time.

tumble  摔倒; 坍塌; 暴跌

​		In order to prevent tragedy — and to preserve the Jiankou wall for future generations — restoration began in 2015 and wrapped up in 2019. For the 2019 phase of the project, technology included drones, 3D mapping and a computer algorithm that could tell engineers whether they had to remove that tree or fix this crack.

​		With the restoration finished, the wall may be less **derelict** and dangerous than it once was. But it remains a striking reminder of the centuries that shaped not only the **fortification**, but China itself.
