## USC professor under fire after using Chinese expression students allege sounds like English slur

​		A business professor at the University of Southern California became the center of an international academic controversy, after the school administration received a letter accusing him of using Chinese words that sounded like an English racial **slur**.

slur  诽谤; 侮辱

​		Professor Greg Patton of USC's Marshall School of Business was teaching a communications class via Zoom call. An online video recording of the call shows Patton giving an example of how Chinese speakers use filler words.

​		"In China, the common word is 'that', " he said in the video, before using the equivalent Chinese term nei ge several times to demonstrate.

​		The following day, a complaint was filed to the school administration, saying the term sounded like the N-word."This phrase is always identified as a **phonetic** homonym and a racial **derogatory** term, " according to the letter, which accused Patton of **negligence**.

​		A week later, Marshall School Dean Geoffrey Garrett announced that a different professor would take over teaching Patton's class.

​		The incident sparked widespread online controversy after making news headlines. Members of academia, including those of Black and Chinese descent, **blasted** USC and voiced outrage on social media on Patton's behalf.

blast  爆破; 猛烈抨击

​		Some pointed out that labeling nei ge or its pronunciation as offensive only makes sense within an **Anglophone** bubble — that doing so portrays the Chinese language as subject to English rules rather than independent and possessing its own contexts.

​		Weibo users echoed American criticisms that this may be an example of cultural sensitivity gone wrong, with a few comments **likening** the incident to "literary **inquisition**, " the historical Chinese **persecution** of intellectuals for their writings.
