## Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade revives Broadway for a day

​		Broadway may be dark for several months to come, but actors from four **shuttered** shows have been given the opportunity to put on their costumes and perform. The venue: Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.

shuttered  关上(或装有)护窗的

​		The term parade is being used loosely this year. The helium-filled balloons and star-studded floats will not be traveling their typical jam-packed, 2 1/2-mile route starting at West 77th Street. They will be gliding just one city block down 34th Street, near the flagship department store, and without an audience.

​		But even if it's more television show than crowd fest this year, the parade will provide a **respite** from the **doldrums** of a closed Broadway with performances by the casts of "Hamilton, " "Mean Girls, " "**Jagged** Little Pill, " and "Ain't Too Proud: The Life and Times of the **Temptations**, " all shows that have not taken the stage since March.

respite  暂停; 暂缓

doldrums  忧郁; 郁闷

jagged  参差不齐的

temptations  引诱 ; 诱惑

​		This is the 94th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and it has been reimagined in almost every way. Usually, it has 8, 000 to 10, 000 people working the route, said Susan Tercero, the event's executive producer. This year, there will be about 1, 500.

​		And the massive balloons will no longer be flown by smiling, uniformed handlers but instead driven by **utility** vehicles to limit the number of people involved.

utility  多用途的

​		In New York, where the worst impact of the virus has **waned** but cases are climbing again, the parade planning team at Macy's aimed to feature artists who have been deprived of the opportunity to perform over the past several months.

wane  衰落;衰败

​		"Why not showcase New York at a time when a lot of people have missed being able to participate and watch these types of performances and cultural displays?" Tercero said.
