## Oxford Dictionaries: 2020 has too many Words of the Year to name just one

​		For the first time, the Oxford English Dictionary has chosen not to name a word of the year, describing 2020 as "a year which cannot be neatly accommodated in one single word".

​		Tracking its vast corpus of more than 11bn words found in web-based news, blogs and other text sources, its lexicographers revealed what the dictionary described as "**seismic** shifts in language data and **precipitous** frequency rises in new **coinage**" over the past 12 months.

seismic  地震的; 重大的

precipitous  陡峭的; 险峻的

coinage  货币

​		"Coronavirus", one of its words of the year, is a term that dates back to the 1960s."Covid-19", first recorded on 11 February in a report by the World Health Organization, quickly overtook coronavirus in frequency of use.

​		One of the year's most remarkable linguistic developments, according to the OED, has been the extent to which scientific terms have entered general discourse, as we have all become armchair epidemiologists, with most of us now familiar with the term "R number".

​		The revolution in working habits has also affected language."On mute" and "unmute" have seen 500% rises since March, while the portmanteaus "workation" and "**staycation**" increased by 500% and 380% respectively.

staycation  宅度假

​		Previous choices for word of the year from Oxford have included "climate emergency" and "post truth".Rival dictionary Collins chose "lockdown" for its word of the year earlier this month.

​		"I've never witnessed a year in language like the one we've just had, " said Oxford Dictionaries president Casper Grathwohl."It's both unprecedented and a little **ironic** — in a year that left us speechless, 2020 has been filled with new words unlike any other."
