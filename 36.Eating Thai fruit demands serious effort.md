## Eating Thai fruit demands serious effort

​		Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has called Thailand "the Great Power nation of fruit."Last year, the country ranked as the world's sixth biggest fruit exporter.

​		But most of the fruit is exported to Thailand's regional neighbors, with China its biggest customer. Less than 3% of Thailand's fruit was exported to the United States. Distance is one problem, as are worries about **fruit flies** accompanying the imports. But the main reason for the low figure may be that Southeast Asia's **indigenous** fruits have what Fuchsia Dunlop, a British author of Chinese cookbooks, calls a high "grapple factor."

​		Many of the region's fruits require serious **commitment** to eat: **laborious** peeling, careful chewing and the frequent spitting out of seeds to which meat stubbornly adheres. **Dissecting** a jackfruit is to hack through a jagged sheath, then **painstakingly** pluck out **rubbery** polyps that taste like overripe Juicy Fruit gum. The process can consume an afternoon.

​		The most **infamous** fruit, which stinks of death, is the durian. The durian's flavor **elicits** passionate, and polarizing, responses, with few **indifferent** about the fruit's appeal or **repulsiveness**. On the outside, the durian resembles a medieval torture device. Nestled inside the **spiky** shell are kidney-shaped lobes of custard. Even if the smell could be put aside, the durian would still probably have the highest grapple factor among Southeast Asia's **endemic** fruits. Thai exports of the fruit are mostly destined for China, where consumers tend to be more willing to work for their meals.
