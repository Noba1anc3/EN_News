## For Japanese princess, fairy-tale wedding may be distant prospect

​		When Princess Mako of Japan became engaged to her college boyfriend in 2017, many Japanese hoped for a fairy-tale wedding for the couple.

​		But three years later, the prospects of the eldest daughter of Crown Prince Akishino and her beau, Kei Komuro, a commoner and aspiring lawyer, living happily ever after look, well, complicated.

​		In remarks released Monday, Akishino said he approved of the wedding. But he also said that there appeared to be opposition to the union in Japan, making it difficult to proceed with an official ceremony.

​		The couple, both 29, were originally set to marry in 2018, but the date was pushed back after Japanese **tabloids** caught wind of money problems in Komuro's family. His mother had become embroiled in a dispute with a former fiance of hers over $36, 000, some of which was reportedly used for Komuro's schooling.

​		The reports raised questions about Komuro's intentions, with some **detractors** accusing him of being a gold digger. The **whiff** of scandal proved too much for many Japanese, not to mention the sensibilities of the imperial family.

​		The ups and downs of the prospective couple are a reminder of the fragility of the world's oldest **monarchy**.

​		Japanese law forbids women from ascending the throne, and heirs must come from the male line of succession. Following the **abdication** of Emperor Akihito last year and the ascension of his son Naruhito to the **Chrysanthemum** Throne, only two potential heirs remain: the **crown prince** and his son.

​		Under Japanese law, if Mako marries Komuro she will have to leave the imperial family and become a commoner herself, even if the wedding was officially **sanctioned**, further shrinking the already tiny royal **clan**.
