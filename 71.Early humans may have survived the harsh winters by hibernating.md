## Early humans may have survived the harsh winters by hibernating

​		Bears do it. Bats do it. Even European **hedgehogs** do it. And now it turns out that early human beings may also have been at it. They **hibernated**, according to fossil experts.

hibernate  冬眠

​		Evidence from bones found at one of the world's most important fossil sites suggests that our hominid **predecessors** may have dealt with extreme cold hundreds of thousands of years ago by sleeping through the winter.

predecessor  前任；原有的东西

​		The conclusion is based on **excavations** in a cave called Sima de los Huesos — the pit of bones — at Atapuerca, in northern Spain. The fossils date back more than 400, 000 years and were probably from early Neanderthals or their predecessors.

​		In a paper published in the journal "L'Anthropologie", Juan-Luis Arsuaga and Antonis Bartsiokas argue that the fossils found there show seasonal variations that suggest that bone growth was disrupted for several months of each year.

​		The pattern of **lesions** found in the human bones at the Sima cave are consistent with lesions found in bones of hibernating mammals, including cave bears."A strategy of hibernation would have been the only solution for them to survive having to spend months in a cave due to the **frigid** conditions, " the authors state.

​		They examine several counter-arguments. Modern Inuit and Sámi people — although living in equally harsh, cold conditions — do not hibernate. So why did the people in the Sima cave?

​		The answer, say Arsuaga and Bartsiokas, is that fatty fish and reindeer fat provide Inuit and Sami people with food during winter and so **preclude** the need for them to hibernate. In contrast, the area around the Sima site half a million years ago would not have provided anything like enough food.
