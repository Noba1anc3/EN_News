## How to best play the hand you're dealt in life

​		A little more than a year before, the psychologist and writer Maria Konnikova had taken a large gamble — the decision to take a sabbatical from her staff job at the New Yorker to train (from scratch) as a professional poker player. Now, she was competing in the PokerStars Caribbean Adventure National Championship. Over three days, Konnikova beat 290 competitors to win the trophy.

​		Luck or skill?

​		While skill can predict your overall **trajectory** across many tournaments, your performance at any particular moment is still the victim of chance. In general, humans tend to `over-estimate` the role of our own skill thanks to our "illusion of control".

trajectory  轨道

​		To avoid that trap, you need to start thinking probabilistically. A good probabilistic thinker would be able to recognize the role of luck in the outcomes while **objectively** analyzing the quality of the `decision-making` underneath. It is the quality of the reasoning, rather the outcome, that matters if you want to improve your `long-term` performance.

objectively  客观地

'Tilting'

​		Besides this **appreciation** of uncertainty, Konnikova also had to learn to deal with 'tilting'.Examples of tilting could include that **despair** that comes from a string of bad luck, or it could be the overconfidence that comes from a win. There is no way to escape it completely, but there are some ways to cope better with its effects.

appreciation  理解; 欣赏; 感谢

despair  绝望

​		This includes cultivating greater emotional awareness — "constantly checking in with yourself to see 'what am I feeling?' and 'How am I reacting to this?'" she says. Once you have identified those feelings, you should then try to analyze how they're influencing your judgement, and whether you should try to account for that in your final decision.
