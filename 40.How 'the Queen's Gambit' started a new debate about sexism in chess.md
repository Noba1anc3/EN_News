## How 'the Queen's Gambit' started a new debate about sexism in chess

​		Judit Polgar might be the one woman in the world who knows how Beth, the **heroine** of the hit Netflix series "The Queen's Gambit, " really feels. Like Beth, Polgar, who is from Hungary, stood out during her career.

sexism  性别歧视

heroine  女英雄

​		Watching the series gave Polgar a sense of déjà vu. But there was one respect in which she could not identify with Beth's experience: how the male competitors treated her.

​		When Polgar was proving herself in the world rankings, the men often made **disparaging** comments about her ability and sometimes jokes, which they thought were funny but were actually hurtful, she said.

disparaging  贬低的; 诋毁的; 轻蔑的

​		Though chess would seem like one area where men and women should be able to compete on equal footing, historically, few women have been able to do so. Among the more than 1, 700 regular grandmasters worldwide, only 37 are women.

​		The **dearth** of women at the top of the game is one reason that there are separate tournaments for women; the World Chess Federation even created titles for women, such as women grandmaster.

dearth  缺乏; 不足

​		While some men have speculated that the reason there are so few top female players is because they are not wired for it, women think the **overriding** reason is cultural expectations and bias.

overriding  最重要的; 首要的; 凌驾一切的

​		The cultural **cleaving** between boys and girls happens at a young age. That creates and reinforces another problem that discourages women's participation: too few social contacts. Jennifer Shahade, a two-time U.S. women's champion, said teenage girls tend to stop playing chess because there are so few of them and they want the social support.

cleave  劈开; 砍开

​		Shahade, who grew up admiring Polgar, said it was "totally inspiring" to see Beth's story unfold.
