## How to build a nuclear warning for 10,000 years' time

​		"This place is not a place of honor, " reads the text."What is here was dangerous and **repulsive** to us. This message is a warning about danger."

repulsive  令人反感的; 排斥的

​		It sounds like the kind of curse that you half-expect to find at the entrance to an ancient burial **mound**. But this message is intended to help mark the site of the Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP).The huge complex of tunnels and **caverns** is designed to contain the US military's most dangerous nuclear waste.

mound  土墩

cavern  洞穴

​		When the facility is full, the caverns will be sealed with concrete and soil. The sprawling complex of buildings that currently mark the site will be erased. In its place will be "our society's largest conscious attempt to communicate across the **abyss** of deep time".

abyss  深渊

​		Welcome to the world of nuclear **semiotics**. Nuclear physicists, engineers, anthropologists, sci-fi writers, artists and others have come together in the very broad, esoteric field of research into the way that future humans — and anything that comes after us — might be warned of our deadly **legacy**.

semiotics  符号学

legacy  遗产; 遗留

​		Sadly, the idea to cover the site with a forest of massive concrete **thorns** was not taken up. Neither was the idea of breeding cats that would change color when exposed to radiation.

thorn  刺; 荆棘

​		"The most successful approach would have a number of systems that complement each other, such as a combination of physical markers with information about the site stored in numerous archives, " says James Pearson, who worked on the RK&M Initiative.

​		It is also about trying to integrate the facilities into future societies.

​		"You don't have to try to scare people away by looking **menacing** and symbolizing danger. You need to inform people of what's there, so they can then make an informed decision for themselves."

menace  威胁; 危险
