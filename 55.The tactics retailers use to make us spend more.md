## The tactics retailers use to make us spend more

​		Britons collectively spend up to £1bn every month on **impulse** buys, according to a survey last year by 118 118 Money. While mental health, mood and personality all play a role in that, consumer psychology is increasingly being used to shape our choices online.

impulse  冲动

​		Some of the most common ways retailers tap into psychology include rushing us into decisions and persuading us that we are missing out if we don't make a purchase.

​		Scarcity: Anything limited creates a sense of urgency and **primes** us to act quickly. Sales are by definition limited. Hotel websites also use this when they say four rooms are available but five people are viewing them.

​		Thresholds on free shipping work the same way. The pain of missing out on a freebie can **nudge** us into spending a bit more, even if we do not need or want the extra items.

nudge  轻推

​		Social proof: Reviews, recommendations and likes signal that a product is already tried and tested, so it feels safe. It works because we are a herd species: we copy each other to show we fit in, and because copying is an easier cognitive process. Some brands tap into this by revealing what other consumers bought.

​		**Frictionless** paying: Once we are primed to spend, frictionless payment options such as one-click and guest checkout help us to check out before second thoughts kick in. Buy now, pay later options also give the illusion of payment flexibility and, therefore, affordability, while playing down that it is a form of debt.
