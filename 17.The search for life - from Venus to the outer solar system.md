## The search for life - from Venus to the outer solar system

​		It remains one of the most unexpected scientific discoveries of the year. To their astonishment, British scientists last week revealed they had uncovered strong evidence that **phosphine** — a toxic, **rancid** gas produced by **microbes** — exists in the burning, acid-drenched atmosphere of Venus.

phosphine  磷化氢

rancid  变质的; 变味的

microbe  微生物

​		By rights, it should simply not be there."All the geological and **photochemical** routes we can think of are far too underproductive to make the phosphine we have seen, " said Cardiff University astronomer Professor Jane Greaves, leader of the team who made the discovery.

photochemical  光化学的

​		And that conclusion leaves scientists with the **bizarre** prospect that microbial activity — the key source of phosphine on Earth — may be occurring in the **searing**, acidic clouds that **swathe** Venus.

bizarre  极其怪诞的; 异乎寻常的

searing  灼人的; 火辣辣的

swathe  包裹; 覆盖

​		The news also adds a bizarre new planetary focus for scientists hunting alien life on nearby planets. Jupiter was found to possess moons that have deep underground oceans while Titan was discovered to have an atmosphere containing organic chemicals, the building blocks of life. And Venus has just offered itself up as a highly unexpected new candidate for investigation.

​		But, in fact, most astronomers discount the prospect of life thriving in Venus — despite the discovery of phosphine in its atmosphere.
​		Those rancid puffs of gas are most likely being produced by some geochemical process that is currently unknown to science."I doubt if there are any lifeforms on Venus. It is far too **hostile** a place for that, " said astrobiologist Charles Cockell."In any case, there are plenty of other, far more promising places to look in the solar system."

hostile  敌意的; 敌对的
