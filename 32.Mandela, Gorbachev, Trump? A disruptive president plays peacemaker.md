## Mandela, Gorbachev, Trump? A disruptive president plays peacemaker

​		Even before President Donald Trump announced a diplomatic breakthrough between Israel and Bahrain on Friday, he had been nominated twice this past week alone for the Nobel Peace Prize. The nominations, each from a right-wing Scandinavian politician, were met around the world with a mixture of **amusement** and **dismissal**: Much like submitting art or writing for a prize, such a designation doesn't mean much in itself.

amusement  愉悦; 娱乐活动

dismissal  解雇; 驳回

​		But the White House **rejoiced** all the same. After the first nomination Wednesday, the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, opened her briefing that day by calling it "a hard-earned and well-deserved honor for this president."

rejoice  非常高兴

​		Given Trump's worldwide reputation as a dangerous disrupter, he seems exceedingly unlikely to join a cast of **luminaries** that includes Nelson Mandela and Mikhail Gorbachev. But all of the talk of peace prizes does spotlight what in recent weeks has become a core foreign policy message for the president in the **homestretch** of the November election.

luminary  专家; 权威

homestretch  最后一部分

​		Jeremy Rosner, a longtime Democratic pollster with a background in national security, said he was not losing sleep over the prospect of an October surprise emerging from **Oslo**. Nor did he concede any worry that Trump's talk of peace might win over **swing voters**.

​		There are also substantive **caveats** to Trump's fanfare. For all of the White House's talk of historic Middle East peace deals, Israel was not in an actual state of conflict with the UAE or Bahrain. The countries are merely consecrating a quiet alliance that had been developing for years, noted Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress, who said that Trump was like "the rooster taking credit for the dawn."
