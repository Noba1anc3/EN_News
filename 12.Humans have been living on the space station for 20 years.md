## Humans have been living on the space station for 20 years

​		When NASA astronaut William Shepherd and Russian **cosmonauts** Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev entered the International Space Station on November 2, 2000, they became the first of many to live in the orbiting laboratory 227 nautical miles above Earth.

​		Since that initial 136-day stay for **Expedition** 1, the space station has served as a hub for continuous human occupation, scientific research and a proving ground for future space exploration for 20 years.

​		Early in the space station program, the main focus was on assembling and building the space station. After that was completed in 2011, the focus has `shifted to` science. More than 3, 000 scientific investigations have been conducted on the space station. This research has spanned a **multitude** of disciplines.

​		While the research conducted on the space station `sheds light on` how a range of things react to `the lack of gravity`, it has also been used to improve our lives on Earth. Through experiments on the station, we've learned better ways to purify air and water in our homes, developed advancements in **telemedicine**, and found better treatments for diseases like cancer.

​		The space station is also being used as a proving ground as NASA prepares to return humans to the moon by 2024 through its Artemis program, as well as a future human mission to Mars.

​		Going forward, Shepherd believes that a trip to Mars or other locations in the solar system will require large vehicles that will require assembly in orbit, using spacewalks and robotics. It will also require the work, expense and cooperation of multiple countries.

​		"If you look at the International Space Station, it's really a blueprint for how to do this."
