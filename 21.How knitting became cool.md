​		The documented history of knitting begins with a pair of Ancient Egyptian socks, from the 3rd to 5th Century AD. It spread from the Middle East to Europe via **Mediterranean** trade routes in the 14th Century.

​		Knitted wool garments became popular in the UK from Medieval times onwards, because of their `weather-resistant` qualities, particularly among soldiers, sailors and laborers.

​		Like most things in the world of high fashion, knitting has fallen in and out of favor `over the course of` the 20th Century. Sweater sets and A-line skirts, designed by the likes of Emilio Pucci and Missoni, characterized the 1950s and '60s, and designers including Yves Saint Laurent and Calvin Klein have used knits regularly in their collections since, furthering its associations with either **affluence** and preppiness or ease.

​		Designers, artists and hobbyists have `taken this to an extreme` since `the turn of the century`. Avant-garde knitwear designer Katya Zelentsova is one of these "extreme knitters".Her intricate works are sensual, **whimsical** and futuristic hybrid garments that stray far from the typical cardigan or sweater.

​		Internet forums, blogs and social media platforms have been a vital resource, not only `in support of` the work of extreme knitters, but in introducing younger generations to the craft and to keeping the tradition alive.

​		Creators merging `age-old` methods with innovative attitudes are helping reshape widespread attitudes about who knitting is for — and what it signifies.
