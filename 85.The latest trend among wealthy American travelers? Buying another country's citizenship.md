## The latest trend among wealthy American travelers? Buying another country's citizenship

​		For generations, the American passport afforded its holders the privilege of **hassle**-free travel around much of the world. That has changed with the coronavirus pandemic. While borders are beginning to reopen to international travel, some countries are staying closed to Americans because of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak **stateside**.

hassle  困难; 麻烦

stateside  美国的

​		These travel restrictions are producing an emerging trend among some wealthy Americans: buying a second passport.

​		Today there are approximately 25 countries that offer forms of residency or citizenship-by-investment programs as a revenue source.

​		According to Paddy Blewer, public relations director of Henley & Partners, a firm that works with countries and individuals on citizenship-by-investment programs, investment migration "is a way for **sovereign** states to raise debt-free capital and also to drive further foreign direct investment."

sovereign  君主; 元首

​		Blewer says that while Henley & Partners has seen interest in investment migration increase steadily for more than 15 years, the pandemic has brought a significant uptick in **genuine** engagement. Compared with the same period in 2019, January to April 2020 led to a 49 percent increase for the firm in general interest in citizenship by investment, and a 22 percent increase in interest in proceeding with the application process.

genuine  真的; 诚实的

​		The application takes months, if not years, to process, and it includes a thorough investigation into a person's private and financial life. Thus, there is lag time between applying for and receiving a second passport — which is why the approach will not solve any immediate travel problems for those in the United States.

​		"It doesn't matter if you become a St. Lucian citizen or a Maltese citizen; they're not going to let you in because you've been in Florida for the last six months, " says Blewer.
