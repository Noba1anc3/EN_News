## Whatever happened to China's giant piles of abandoned bicycles

​		The bike-sharing craze in China five years ago sucked in billions of dollars of investors' cash and clients' deposits that start-ups spent on millions of new bikes in an effort to grab market share. When the inevitable collapse came, most of the companies went bankrupt, leaving city authorities having to pay to clean up the mess.

​		The sheer volume of abandoned bikes is overwhelming. Xiaoming, just one of the 60 or so bike-sharing app companies that went bust, left 430, 000 of them across more than 10 cities.

​		No one wants to pay for it. The bankrupt companies are gone, mostly unable to even return customers' deposits. The investments have been written off, so the taxpayer has to **foot the bill**. It costs 9.6 yuan to remove each abandoned bike from the street, according to the government in Hangzhou.

​		Also, safety rules mean that even the remaining players have to replace their vehicles every few years. And they have vowed to be responsible for the "whole lifecycle" of their vehicles. Mobike and YUUE discovered that disassembled frames and parts make interesting designer chairs and lamps. Mobike also turned the **rubber** from 7, 800 old tires into the surface for a running track in a town in Shaanxi Province.

​		"As a big internet company, it's important to be both environment-friendly and user-friendly, " said Xie Peng, manager of the green supply chain department of Hellobike, one of the surviving companies.
The firm has found a truly internet-friendly use for some of its retired bikes: a home for **stray** cats.
