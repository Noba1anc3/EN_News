## Forbidden City at 600, How China's imperial palace survived against the odds

​		The Forbidden City, which turns 600 this year, is the world's largest palace complex. The **fortress**-like design was intended to protect the emperor, but also to emphasize his pre-**eminence**: The emperor was, after all, heaven's representative on Earth and his palace was built to ensure that neither his subjects, nor foreign visitors, ever forgot that.

​		Despite its **monumental** scale and central importance in Chinese history, however, the Forbidden City's continuing presence at the heart of the country's capital has been a story of survival against the odds. Fires, wars and power struggles have all threatened the imperial complex during the last six centuries.

monumental  重要的；不朽的

​		In the summer of 1402, Zhu Di, one of Zhu Yuanzhang's sons, claimed the throne for himself, becoming known as the Yongle Emperor and establishing Beijing as the national capital. There he built an imperial palace. The Forbidden City's architects drew design principles from the second-century B.C. text, the "Rites of Zhou".Symmetry was crucial, with a city's boundaries marked by a square wall. At the very center of the complex, protected by another wall, should sit the ruler's palace. The palace buildings, primarily made of wood, were vulnerable to lightning strikes and the open flames used for lighting and heating. To combat the risk of fire, hundreds of metal **vats** were placed around the palace to collect water and early **lightning conductors** were built onto higher roofs. Still, there were regular fires, as well as earthquakes, over the centuries. As a result, almost all of the buildings of the Forbidden City are later reconstructions of the originals.
