## Australian farm to hold 50,000 crocodiles for luxury Hermes goods questioned by animal welfare groups

​		The high-end French fashion brand Hermès wants to build one of Australia's biggest crocodile farms in the Northern Territory that would hold up to 50, 000 saltwater crocodiles to be turned into luxury goods such as handbags and shoes.

​		But the proposal has come under fire from animal welfare groups, who say other fashion brands have moved away from using exotic animal skins on cruelty grounds.

​		Nicola Beynon, of Humane Society International, said brands including Chanel and Mulberry had adopted animal welfare policies "against using exotic animal skins such as crocodile".

​		Dr Jed Goodfellow, a senior policy officer at RSPCA Australia, said generally there were many welfare risks raised by crocodile farming in intensive conditions, "including injuries from close **confinement**, small individual penning arrangements, and the impacts of restraint and slaughter methods".

​		Guardian Australia sent questions to Hermès and asked to speak to a representative, but did not get a response.

​		A 2019 corporate social responsibility report from Hermès said the company had worked across the industry to improve animal welfare standards which had been reviewed by a crocodile group at the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

​		Prof Grahame Webb, chair of the IUCN crocodile specialist group, told the Guardian crocodile farming had helped fund conservation efforts in the region.

​		Unregulated hunting of crocodiles in Australia drove numbers dangerously low until rules protecting them were introduced in the early 1970s, Webb has written. He said the number of saltwater crocodiles in the wild was now healthy and stable.
