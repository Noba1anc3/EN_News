## In the Arctic, reindeer are sustenance and a sacred presence

​		The Sami have herded reindeer for centuries. Although the verb puts humans in the position of authority, to herd is in many ways to submit: to accept the dictates of the animals.“We follow them; they don’t follow us, ” said Anders Oskal, the 47-year-old secretary-general of the Association of World Reindeer Herders.

​		If one of the **precepts** of sustainability is wasting as little as possible, few animals have been honored so completely, and for so long, as the reindeer. When the **pastures** are snowed under and seemingly **barren**, it uses its hooves to **unearth** buried **herbs**. In the tundra and the taiga, its fur and skin are sewed into clothes, blankets and tents. The relationship between herder and reindeer is **symbiotic**. Like the whale to the Inuit, the animal is at once everyday fact and sacred presence.

​		Even today, for many herders, reindeer is the daily meal. Almost every part of the animal is eaten, not just the great tenderloins but the trachea cut in rings, the hooves **simmered** until they leach **jelly**, the mineral-rich blood reserved for sausages and pancakes and as a dip for raw meat. One rule is universal: No one eats the tip of the **tongue**; the Sami believe it will make you lie.
