## Disney plans to match Netflix in its spending on streaming

​		Disney's theme parks may be closed and its cruise ships docked, but the entertainment giant's Disney+ streaming service has been one of the great success stories of the year of lockdown.

​		Wall Street lapped it up. If the stockmarket had any **lingering** doubts, it was over the emptiness of Disney's pipeline of new shows. Aside from "The Mandalorian" and "Hamilton", the service has had few original hits, relying heavily on the Disney archives.

lingering  缠绵的；迟迟不去的

​		In a presentation to investors on December 10th Disney **dispelled** those doubts once and for all. It announced a content binge designed to put it on a par with Netflix — and to shift the company's focus sharply towards streaming.

​		By 2024 its content spending on Disney+ will be $8bn-9bn; across all its streaming channels (which include Hulu and ESPN+) it will be $14bn-16bn.

​		As well as matching Netflix dollar-for-dollar, Disney is broadening its range of content in a way that will make the two streamers more direct rivals. Netflix has had recent hits with documentaries and reality shows. Disney announced that a new service, Star, will carry a wider range of programming, including a new program about the **indefatigable** Kardashian clan.

To help pay for all this the company plans to raise the subscription price of Disney+ by a dollar a month. But that dollar will be multiplied by what it now expects to be 230m-260m subscribers by 2024.This could be enough to make streaming the company's single largest business by revenues, notes Benjamin Swinburne of Morgan Stanley, a bank. It would also probably be enough for Disney to draw level with Netflix in subscribers.
