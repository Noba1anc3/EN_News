​		Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth on Wednesday announced that all the fuel left in the tanks had been pumped out, although about 100 tonnes more was still elsewhere aboard the **vessel**."It was a race against the clock, and I salute the excellent work to prevent another oil spill, " said Jugnauth. Kilometres of floating plastic barriers stuffed with straw and fixed with empty bottles have been stitched together into chains and placed at sea in an effort to hold back the oily tide.
